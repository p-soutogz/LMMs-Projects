Landscape with windswept trees,van Gogh Vincent ,Realism,landscape,"The nearly two years spent in Nuenen, in the southern Netherlands, were very productive in van Gogh’s early artistic career. The present work was painted in 1885, at the very end of this period, just before his departure for Antwerp; his celebrated masterpiece De Aardappeleters (The Potato Eaters), now in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, was painted at this same time. In March of 1885, van Gogh’s father, the Reverend Theodorus van Gogh, collapsed on the threshold of the family home, where the artist still lived. The experience was profoundly influential on this transitional period in van Gogh’s oeuvre. By May, following his father’s death, the artist left the parsonage and rented a small studio and sleeping quarters on his own in town.
 “I have lately been making some studies of the fall landscape outdoors,” wrote van Gogh in October of 1885 (quoted in Jan Hulsker, op. cit., p. 208). The works created in October and November of this year, the present painting included, are all the more poignant and emotive when considered in context of the changes the artist experienced during this year, and the looser application of paint that defines the foliage prefigures the more fiercely dramatic brushwork so characteristic of his later pictures."
The Potato Eaters,van Gogh Vincent ,Realism,genre painting,"For The Potato Eaters, Van Gogh’s first major work, he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He thus chose coarse and ugly models, so they would look as natural as possible in the final work. He made sketches of the work and sent them to his brother, who helped Van Gogh make adjustment in the composition. As far as two years after Van Gogh completed this painting, he considered it his finest work. This painting has also been a main target for art thieves, who have stolen it not once, but twice times. An early version of the painting was stolen in 1988, but later returned with no ransom, and again in 1991, when it was abandoned by the thieves and recovered."
Still life with meadow flowers and roses,van Gogh Vincent ,Realism,still life,"The painting, on a 100 centimeter by 80 centimeter (40x31 inch) canvas, was bought by the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in 1974 as a Van Gogh. The work was thought to come from the artist's period living with his brother Theo in Paris from late 1886.

Experts thought the canvas was too large for that period, the depiction of a vase brimming over with flowers and yet more flowers lying on a table in the foreground was too exuberant, too busy. The signature was in an unusual position for Van Gogh — the top right hand corner.

With the doubts piling up, the museum in 2003 decided to attribute the painting to an anonymous artist instead of to Van Gogh.

But the detective work did not end there.

An X-ray taken five years earlier had already revealed an indistinct image of the wrestlers and continued to interest researchers.

Now, a new more detailed X-ray has shown the wrestlers in more detail, along with the brush strokes and pigments used. They all pointed back to Van Gogh.

Having models pose half naked was a defining characteristic of the Antwerp academy where Van Gogh studied in early 1886. So was the size of the canvas, the Kroeller-Mueller Museum said in a statement.

Vincent wrote to his brother about needing the large canvas, new brushes and paint. Theo helped the penniless artist buy the materials and a week later Van Gogh wrote back that he was delighted with the painting of two wrestlers.

Brush strokes and pigments in the wrestlers painting also corresponded with what experts now know about Van Gogh's work in Antwerp.

The wrestlers also help explain the ""uncharacteristic exuberance"" of the floral still life, the Kroeller-Mueller Museum statement said — Van Gogh had to cover up all of the old image with his new work."
Nude Woman on a Bed,van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,genre painting,"Van Gogh painted very few nudes, partially because he rarely had enough money for hiring models. This work presents the female body with a curious mixture of allure and revulsion. Curvy hips and closed eyes are traditional signs of sensuality, but the exposed body hair and coarse facial features certainly challenge 19th-century conventions of beauty.

Irises,van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,landscape,"Van Gogh painted Irises the year before his death, in 1889, during his stay at the asylum in Saint Remy de Provence. Van Gogh often used painting as a way to keep himself from going insane, and this painting was one such work. It was painted before his first mental attack at the asylum. Van Gogh sent the painting to his brother Theo, who immediately sent it to the Salon des Independants that same year, where it was exhibited and highly praised. It continued to set high price records at auction until it was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles in 1990."
Landscape with House and Ploughman,van Gogh Vincent ,Cloisonnism,landscape,"This landscape is unusual in its elevated, almost bird's-eye point of view. Such an angle can be seen as an attempt to look at the world in the Japanese way, natural for an artist obsessed with Japan. However, we cannot speak of serious influence here: Van Gogh's view was individual and came from his own impressions. The dynamism distinguishing this canvas is alien to Far Eastern landscapes. The painting has an enormous internal energy. The crossing diagonals forming the borders of the fields and the ploughed furrows, the contours of the roofs, the row of cypresses - such vectors strain the composition, but not so much as to disturb the unity of the whole. It is a study from nature. The colouring of the painting and the action of the figures show us that it was executed in autumn, a time when Van Gogh worked not only on the hospital grounds, but outside them as well."
Madame Roulin Rocking the Cradle (A Lullaby),van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,portrait,"Van Gogh painted Augustine Roulin, the wife of Joseph Roulin, in bold, exaggerated colors against a vividly patterned background; the rope in her hands leads to a cradle. At right, the painter inscribed the title ""La Berceuse,"" which means both ""lullaby"" and ""she who rocks the cradle."" Van Gogh once wrote, ""I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we seek to convey by the actual radiance and vibration of our coloring.""

Still Life - Vase with Twelve Sunflowers,van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,flower painting,"Van Gogh created a series of sunflower paintings in 1888. He created them as decorations for the Yellow House in Arles in which Van Gogh’s houseguest, Paul Gaugin would be staying, Unfortunately, due to a falling-out with Gaugin, after which Van Gogh sliced off his own earlobe in a paranoid panic, Van Gogh was never able to decorate his yellow house. He instead sent the paintings to exhibition, imagining the two sunflower paintings one either side of his Berceuse painting, and calling it the Berceuse Triptych, exhibiting the paintings at the Les XX exhibit in Paris. He later displayed all three paintings together at the aforementioned exhibit in 1890."
The Starry Night,van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,cloudscape,"Van Gogh's night sky is a field of roiling energy. Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. ""Looking at the stars always makes me dream,"" he said, ""Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.""
The artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: ""This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big."" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting."
Houses in Auvers 2,van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,landscape,"In May 1890, van Gogh moved from the south of France to Auvers, northwest of Paris, painting many of his finest pictures there in a feverish spurt of activity before his suicide in July. Houses at Auvers shows the landscape of early summer. The view from above creates a flattened tapestry of shapes in which the tiled and thatched roofs of the houses form a mesmerizing patchwork of color.

Portrait of Doctor Gachet,van Gogh Vincent ,Post-Impressionism,portrait,"Portrait of Dr. Gachet is one of Van Gogh’s most famous paintings. The subject is Dr. Paul Gachet, who took care of him during his last years of life. Dr. Gachet had been referred to van Gogh by Camille Pissarro. He treated mainly artists, and was an amateur artist himself. Van Gogh’s first impression of the man was that he was sicker than Van Gogh himself. He completed at least three works of the good doctor, all of which depicted his somber mood and melancholic stance. In 1990, the painting received $82.5 million at auction, a record-breaking price, which continues to be one of the highest prices ever paid for a painting at auction."
First Communion,Picasso Pablo,Realism,genre painting,"""First Communion"" was Picasso’s first large-scale work. The canvas was painted in the atelier of José Garnelo Alda, where Picasso was completing his training following the advice of his father. Garnelo, a friend of José Ruiz’s and the brother of a fellow student of Picasso’s at La Llotja, was himself an art teacher who specialised in religious and moralising subject matter, so Picasso had a range of liturgical objects at his disposal on which to base his composition. In all likelihood, José Garnelo and Picasso’s father chose the motif of this oil painting that would be presented at the Exposition of Fine Arts and Crafts held in Barcelona in 1896, for such subject matter was usually distinguished with the prizes that José Ruiz hoped his son would win at the official salons. Furthermore, Garnelo was very familiar with the theme, for three years before he had painted a similar scene of a young girl, portrayed from the front and dressed for the occasion. The painting is balanced as befits academic standards, and presents a group of figures comprising the little girl dressed for the ceremony, kneeling before a missal on a prie-dieu (in whom we recognise Lola, the artist’s sister), the male character acting as godfather (who has been identified as Doctor Vilches, a friend of Picasso’s father’s) and the godmother (the latter’s wife, according to Palau i Fabre). The three figures appear in profile on three different planes, thereby giving depth to the composition, which is balanced by the figure of the altar boy (the couple’s son). The light source for the scene is located outside the picture plane and reveals Picasso’s technical command, surprising for his age, which is also evinced by the translucence of the girl’s veil, the altar boy’s surplice and the altar cloth, despite their conventionalism. The colour of the painting is also characteristic of the period and befits the religious subject matter: red hues for the walls and the prie-dieu, forming a contrast with the brilliant white of the girl’s dress. The discreet motifs of the carpet and the striped cloth, along with the bright cheerful colours of the altar flowers enhance the colouring of the ensemble. Two studies for First Communion in a sketchbook in the museum’s collection show the figure of Lola kneeling before the prieu-dieu reading the missal, and other sketches and depictions of the altar boy are also kept in the museum.

Science and Charity,Picasso Pablo,Realism,genre painting,"Science and Charity is one of the major works from Picasso’s early years of training. At just 15, Picasso felt mature enough to take on large ambitious compositions as the culmination of his academic studies in Barcelona School of Fine Arts that were led by his father Jose Ruiz Picasso, who was the model for the doctor in this painting. Science and Charity was awarded an Honorary Mention at the General Fine Arts Exhibition in Madrid in spring 1897 and the Gold Medal at the Provincial Exhibition in Malaga held afterwards. After that, Joaquin Martinez de la Vega – a painter and a friend of Picasso’s father – held a glass of champagne and, letting a few drops fall on Picasso’s head, baptized him a Painter. And Picasso’s uncle, impressed by this wonderful achievement, sent money so that his nephew could study further in Madrid. However, despite the success, this would be Picasso’s last great work in traditional academic style. He left behind the intention, fostered by his father, to shape a career based on prizes and awards, to seek his artistic path outside and beyond the academy."
La Maja con Bandolina,Picasso Pablo,Expressionism,portrait,"Created by Pablo Picasso, March 7, 1907 in the City of Rome and given to his friend and private secretary Jaime Sabartes Gual while the ink was still drying. The work has been in exhibitions in New York and City of Milan, but mostly held in Sabartes private collection until 1960.
It is documented with a written statement by Jaime Sabartes recalling the day he received the painting from Picasso and having it signed.

The painting measures 45 cm by 34 cm, being one of Oil on Buta Percha and signed in dry iron oxide and vegetal resin. It is believed that it depicts one of Picasso's lovers holding a Bandolina. The painting celebrates 110 years, now in a private collection and has not been shown in over 50 years."
Harlequin and woman with necklace,Picasso Pablo,Cubism,portrait,"""With this large composition made in Rome in 1917, Picasso takes full advantage of the aesthetic of collage, characteristic of late Cubism. Flat and geometric forms seem to be superimposed onto each other, as if they were underscored by the cut-outs of blue, grey, black and white and stippled surfaces. The overall effect is of a meticulous cut-out that is brought to life by some more realistic elements that are not devoid of humour, like the lady's necklace and her pointed nose. This composition also has a decidedly decorative dimension, reminding us of the painter's collaboration at the time with the Ballets Russes for the curtain and décors of Parade."""
Minotaur is wounded,Picasso Pablo,"Expressionism, Neoclassicism",mythological painting,"The mythical Minotaur—part man, part bull—was Picasso's alter ego in the 1930s and part of a broader exploration of Classicism that persisted in his work for many years. The Minotaur was also emblematic for Surrealists, who saw it as the personification of forbidden desires. For Picasso it expressed complex emotions at a time of personal turmoil. The Minotaur symbolized lasciviousness, violence, guilt, and despair."
The Remains of Minotaur in a harlequin costume,Picasso Pablo,"Neoclassicism, Surrealism",symbolic painting,"This artwork was painted in 1936 as the stage curtain for Romain Rolland's play [i]Le 14 Juillet[/i]. The work, which stands about 9 metres high and more than 12 metres across, has little direct reference to the play and was apparently hurriedly completed as an enlargement from a small gouache - an opaque watercolour - which had been finished long before the commission. 

The subject is a strange choice, because there is no iconographic or narrative link to Romain Rolland's enthusiastic play. There is evidence, though, that the artist did try a Revolutionary design but did not have the time to complete it. There is a curious drawing dated June 13, 1936 which shows a joyful crowd with what looks like a symbolic reference to the taking of the Bastille. On the other hand, Picasso was obsessed by personal allusions at the time with reference to mythology and bullfighting. You can see in the curtain the confrontation of good and evil, the victory of youth, and beauty conquering menace, which was a logical rapprochement of the epic themes of both Picasso and Rolland.

Picasso was so attached to the work that he kept it in his Paris atelier throughout the war, and only donated it to Toulouse, a southern city with a strong bullfighting tradition, in 1965. At present the curtain is in its own gallery in the Espace d'Art Moderne et Contemporain, Toulouse, France."
Guernica,Picasso Pablo,"Cubism, Surrealism",allegorical painting,"[i]Guernica[/i] was Picasso's response to the bombing of the Basque town of the same name on April 26, 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Picasso was commissioned by the republican government of Spain to produce a mural painting for the Spanish Pavilion at the World Fair in Paris. Painted in one month - from May to June 1937 - [i]Guernica[/i] became the centerpiece of the Spanish pavilion and a sensation at the Fair, but it was consequently banned from exhibition in Spain until military dictator Franco fell from power in 1975. 

Picasso had studied dramatic photographs of bombing published in various periodicals. Despite that, neither the studies nor the finished picture contain a single allusion to a specific event, constituting instead a generic plea against the barbarity and terror of war. The scene depicted in [i]Guernica[/i] is a room full of moving, screaming and dying adults, children and animals. Most of the individual images are also symbols: a bull (virility of man), a woman with a dead child (pieta image), a horse (innocent people), a dead soldier with stigmata (martyrdom), a blazing light (bombs), a prison cell (torture), a dove (peace).

[i]Guernica[/i] is painted in monochrome, using a palette of grey, black, and white. Perhaps Picasso wanted to give his painting a veneer of photojournalistic realism; or maybe the bleak, night-time colour scheme complemented the jagged shapes and terror-stricken faces, and added to the sense of panic and terror. In any event, the lack of colour gives added impact to the flattened Cubist forms, and adds to the drama of the work by allowing Picasso to highlight key faces and objects in white. This painting is undoubtedly modern art's most famous response to war, and an international symbol of genocide committed during wartime."
Weeping Woman,Picasso Pablo,Surrealism,portrait,"During 1937 Picasso became obsessed with the motif of a weeping woman, which symbolised for him the anguish and devastation of the Spanish Civil War. The figure first appeared among the sketches for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937][i]Guernica[/i][/url], his famous depiction of the German bombing raid on a Basque town. Picasso produced between sixty and seventy preparatory works and postscripts to [i]Guernica[/i]. Of the subjects he explored the most frequently depicted image is that of a single female head, bearing an expression of anguish and engulfed in tears. There has been traced thirty-six unique works depicting such images, executed between May and the end of October 1937: 9 paintings on canvas, 21 drawings on paper or card, and 6 small drawings on matchboxes.

The ‘architecture’ of the woman's face in [i]Weeping Woman[/i] is, however, very different from the flat outlined faces of [i]Guernica[/i]. Furthermore, the brilliant and brash colouring of this painting was not only shocking in itself but particularly powerful in being associated with grief. 

The model for the entire [i]Weeping Woman[/i] series was a professional photographer [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dora-maar]Dora Maar[/url], who was one of the leading surrealist artists of the 1930s. After meeting Picasso in Paris, in 1936, she became his mistress, muse, and intellectual companion. A strong personality, she was instrumental in expanding Picasso's political awareness, and he painted her dozens of times over the course of their relationship from 1936 to 1943. 

[i]Weeping Woman[/i] was purchased from Picasso by the British Surrealist artist Roland Penrose shortly after it had been completed in early November 1937. Penrose contextualized this artwork as a Surrealist painting and as a major postscript to [i]Guernica[/i]."
Bull's Head,Picasso Pablo,"Surrealism, Dada",sculpture,"Picasso’s engagement with sculpture was episodic. He would dabble in three dimensions, go back to painting for years at a time, then return to a totally new type of sculpture: wire constructions in the 1930s, ceramics in the 40s, sheet metal follies in the 50s. His dealer, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, is said to have introduced to Picasso the then-novel concept that he might be a “painter-sculptor.” The two disciplines were walled off from one another by different craft traditions, with sculptors requiring training in specific media, like clay and bronze, that Picasso did not have.

Amid Picasso’s constant reinventions, the implication of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-media/assemblage]assemblage[/url] took a while to work its way through the system. The most famous of all Picasso’s found-object works hails from  1942. Laboring amid the relative privation of occupied Paris, he grafted a bicycle seat to a set of handlebars, a mythic bull’s head conjured from the detritus of urban life like the face of Jesus radiating from the Shroud of Turin. Bull’s Head was cast in bronze, and what Picasso had to say about that decision is interesting: [i]The marvelous thing about bronze is that it can give the most heterogeneous objects such unity that it’s sometimes difficult to identify the elements that compose it. But that’s also a danger: if you were to see only the bull’s head and not the bicycle seat and handlebars that form it, the sculpture would lose some of its impact.[/i] With this quote, Picasso seems to stand at a crossroads between different ways of thinking about art. His sculptures vibrate with the energy of transmissions picked up from everyday material culture, but he is still committed to the ennobling virtues of traditional materials, afraid that these everyday materials won’t add up to much on their own.

As an artist, Picasso will always be associated with painting, and specifically with Cubism, the ur modernist -ism. Yet for all its transformative power, the specific theories of Cubist painting were dated for artists working a generation later, a mode consigned to a previous era of development.

Assemblage, on the other hand, was one of the main events of the century to come. It represented the conceptual innovation necessary for visual artists to adapt to a world of mass-produced industrial objects and ever-more intensive media images. And so, in the light of history, Picasso’s sculpture ends up looking like it has more depth."
Bull (plate XI),Picasso Pablo,Cubism,animal painting,"Pablo Picasso created 'Bull' around the Christmas of 1945. 'Bull' is a suite of eleven lithographs that have become a master class in how to develop an artwork from the academic to the abstract. In this series of images, all pulled from a single stone, Picasso visually dissects the image of a bull to discover its essential presence through a progressive analysis of its form. Each plate is a successive stage in an investigation to find the absolute 'spirit' of the beast.

In the final print of the series, Picasso reduces the bull to a simple outline which is so carefully considered through the progressive development of each image, that it captures the absolute essence of the creature in as concise an image as possible."
Seated Woman with Red Hat,Picasso Pablo,Surrealism,portrait,"Seated Woman with Red Hat was created using a layered glass technique called gemmail; it uses individual pieces of colored glass overlapped and joined together with clear liquid enamel and then fired. When illuminated from behind, gemmail produces a result that modulates color and captures light through many layers and textures of glass. Although Picasso was less-known for this art form, he produced 50 or more gemmaux masterpieces during his two years of study at the Malherbe Studio in France."
Annunciation,da Vinci Leonardo,Early Renaissance,religious painting,"[i]Annunciation[/i] (ca. 1472) is one of Leonardo da Vinci’s earlier works, which was commissioned by the church of San Bartolomeo in Monte Oliveto. Leonardo painted with oil and tempera on wood, an untraditional choice since oil was usually used on canvas. From its rectangular shape and size, the painting was likely intended for the sacristy (a room where priests prepare for service and objects of worship are held) of the newly renovated church. Prior to 1869, [i]Annunciation[/i] was attributed to Florentine painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/domenico-ghirlandaio]Domenico Ghirlandaio[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio]Andrea Verrocchio[/url]. However, radiographic and spectrographic tests as well as newly discovered preparatory sketches indicate that Leonardo painted [i]Annunciation[/i] while he was training in the workshop of Andrea Verrocchio. Various sketches by Leonardo, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/lily][i]Lily[/i][/url] (1473-1475), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/sleeve-study-for-the-annunciation-1473][i]The Study of a Sleeve[/i][/url] (1473), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-study-of-a-drapery-of-a-figure-kneeling][i]The Study of a Drapery of a Figure Kneeling[/i][/url] (1473) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/the-study-of-drapery-of-a-seated-figure-1473][i]The Study of Drapery of a Seated Figure[/i][/url] (1473) demonstrate his extensive preparatory work for [i]Annunciation[/i].

The depicted scene is based on the New Testament: the Angel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary announcing to her that she was chosen by God to be the mother of his Son. Leonardo demonstrates innovation and creativity in his composition, which differs from the traditional depictions of the Annunciations, such as Filippo Lippi’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/filippo-lippi/annunciation-1445][i]Annunciation[/i][/url] (1445) and Fra Angelico [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fra-angelico/annunciation][i]Annunciation[/i][/url] (ca. 1435), that portray an interior setting with a partial view of a landscape. Leonardo’s [i]Annunciation[/i] is in an open courtyard of a Renaissance palace with a Tuscan landscape and seascape in the background. The landscape was painted in the [i]sfumato[/i] technique, which softens the transition between colors, so the human eye does not perceive boundaries and lines. Through this technique, Leonardo captured the diffusion of air changes, giving the illusion of a continuous flow of air and mist.

Leonardo carefully conceived each element in the [i]Annunciation[/i], making complex connections to the life and death of Christ. For instance, the carpet of spring flowers relates to the religious scene: the lily whites, daisies, white champions, morning glories and lavender all symbolize the Virgin’s innocence and purity. Other flowers, such as irises, passion flowers and myositis are associated with her feeling of love and mourning. Another important element in Annunciation is the marble lectern placed between the Virgin Mary and the Angel Gabriel. The lectern is a combination of a Renaissance baby cradle and a sarcophagus, thus it symbolizes both the birth and death of Christ. This is also seen in other paintings like Raphael’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/holy-family-known-as-the-grande-famille-of-francois-i-1518][i]The Holy Family of Francis I[/i][/url] (1518) and Lorenzo Lotto’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lorenzo-lotto/madonna-with-st-jerome-and-st-anthony-of-padua-1521][i]Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Nicholas of Tolentino[/i][/url] (1524). Leonardo decorated the lectern with classical motifs like acanthus leaves, garlands, scallop shells and lion’s paws. In its design, the lectern is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrocchio/tomb-of-giovanni-and-pietro-de-medici-1472]the sarcophagus designed by Verrocchio for Giovanni de’ Medici[/url] (1472) at the Old Sacristy in the Church of St. Lorenzo in Florence. By placing the lectern in a blooming meadow, Leonardo adds another layer of meaning: the lectern alludes to a mortuary and Christ’s death, while the flowers symbolize the present moment and his life."
The Lady with an Ermine (Cecilia Gallerani),da Vinci Leonardo,High Renaissance,portrait,"The portrait [i]Lady with an ermine[/i] (1489-1490) by Leonardo Da Vinci depicts Cecilia Gallerani, the teenage mistress of Ludovico Sforza, the regent and later the Duke of Milan. While some scholars doubted this identification, ample evidence affirms Cecilia Gallerani is the subject of [i]Lady with an ermine[/i]. The earliest mention of the portrait appears in a sonnet by court poet Bernardo Bellincioni, in which he notes that it seems as if Cecilia is listening to an unseen speaker. Further confirmation exists in a correspondence between Cecilia and Isabella d’Este, the marquise of Mantua. In her letter, the marquise asks Cecilia to send her the portrait so she can compare Leonardo’s work to that of another master, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url]. Most importantly, the correspondence reveals that although Ludovico commissioned the painting, Cecilia owned it.

It is possible that because Cecilia was not of the highest rank, Leonardo allowed himself the freedom to break away from local conventions of portraiture. Most notably, he abandoned the local tradition of the profile portrait in favor of a three quarter view of the subject. Through the innovative pose Leonardo provoked the viewer’s curiosity and engaged them with the sitter of the portrait: she seems to be attentively gazing at something or someone out of view at the right side of the picture. The lady holds the ermine with her left hand, while her right hand elegantly caresses the animal’s shoulder. The suggestive hand gesture recurs in Leonardo’s later composition [i]Leda and the Swan[/i]  - even though the oil painting did not survive, the overall composition is known from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/leda-and-the-swan-1506]drawings[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/il-sodoma/leda-and-the-swan-copy-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1515]oil copies[/url] made after Leonardo’s painting. In [i]Lady with an ermine[/i], Leonardo also demonstrated tremendous skill in his treatment of contrasting textures: the smooth skin next to the ermine’s fur, the carved jet-black beads against the chest and the intricately woven dress, the embroidered garment besides the smooth plain silk.

One of the key elements of the painting is the lively creature Cecilia holds in her arms. In fact, the symbolism of the ermine provides further evidence supporting the identification of Cecilia as the sitter. The ermine is a symbol of moderation and purity, and as such, its inclusion is appropriate for a portrait of a mistress of a Renaissance duke. Scholars also pointed to the fact that the Greek word for ermine is [i]galé[/i], thus it is a play on the Cecelia’s surname (Gallerani). Additionally, some have suggested that the ermine is an emblem associated to Ludovico, thus the ermine can be interpreted as an allusion to Cecilia’s lover.

[i]Lady with an ermine[/i] was purchased in Italy around 1800 by the Polish Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. He brought the painting to Poland, where he presented it to his mother, the Princess Izabella. The painting was incorporated into the family collection in Puławy, the museum founded by Princess Izabella in 1796. Today, it is the highlight of the collection at the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków, and is considered one of Poland’s national treasures."
The Last Supper,da Vinci Leonardo,High Renaissance,religious painting,"One of the most famous paintings in the world, [i]The Last Supper[/i] by Leonardo da Vinci was painted in the late 15th century for the Dominican monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. The wall painting was commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo’s patron during his first extended stay in Milan.

The composition of [i]The Last Supper[/i] is neatly arranged - Jesus is positioned in the center of a long table and the Apostles are to his left and right. The room is relatively plain: dark tapestries cover the walls on either side, while three windows on the back wall reveal a landscape that recalls the countryside of Milan. Leonardo created the illusion of space by using linear perspective – a technique in which all parallel lines in the painting converge in a single vanishing point. In [i]The Last Supper[/i], the single vanishing point, at Jesus’s right temple, draws the viewer’s attention to the main subject in the foreground. Jesus adorns the traditional blue and red robes, but he has no halo. Some scholars have suggested that Leonardo alludes to the halo through the shining light from the window behind Jesus, or the pediment above the window. Others however believed that the absence of the halo signifies the fact that Jesus is a still human being, who, as such, will suffer through the pain and death of the Passion.

In his depiction of [i]The Last Supper[/i], Leonardo chose to present the scene as a depiction of successive moments: Jesus has declared to the Apostles that one of them will betray him, and the Apostles react to his announcement. The serene expression and posture of Christ stands in contrast to the confused and agitated state of the Apostles. Their reactions and postures vary, adding interest and drama to the composition: on Christ’s left, James the Greater throws his arms out in anger, Thomas gestures to the sky as if to question God’s plan, and Phillip points towards himself wondering could he be the traitor. Some reactions hold additional symbolism: Peter holds a knife behind his back that he will later use to cut off an ear of a soldier attempting to arrest Christ. Judas, who is next to Peter, tightly grips the purse with the reward he received for betraying Jesus with one hand, while he reaches toward a dish with the other. Judas and Jesus reach for the same dish, a reference to the biblical quote: “[i]The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me[/i]” (Matthew 26:23).

When painting [i]The Last Supper[/i] Leonardo used an experimental technique, working with tempera and oil paint. The experimental technique combined with the humidity and the dampness of the location led to the quick deterioration of the painting. Over the centuries, the painting suffered additional damage. Due to its poor condition, the painting underwent a major restoration that began in 1978. The restoration, completed in 1999, proved controversial: many were dissatisfied with the outcome saying that hardly any of Leonardo’s original work is visible. Still, some praised the recovery of many details, like the food on the table and the facial expressions."
Battle of Anghiari,da Vinci Leonardo,High Renaissance,battle painting,"A copy possibly made from the original incomplete work after a fresco by Leonardo da Vinci in the Palazzo della Signoria in Florence, executed in 1504-1505 and destroyed around 1560. 
In March 2012, it was announced that a team led by Maurizio Seracini has found evidence that the Lost Leonardo still exists on a hidden inner wall behind a cavity, underneath a section of Vasari's fresco in the chamber of Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. 
Its central scene depicted four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at The Battle of Anghiari in 1440. Purportedly, from left to right are Francesco Piccinino; Niccolò Piccinino; Ludovico Trevisan; Giovanni Antonio Del Balzo Orsini."
The Virgin and Child with St. Anne,da Vinci Leonardo,High Renaissance,religious painting,"Like with many of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpieces, there are many unknown facts about his painting [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] (ca. 1503-1519). It has been suggested that the painting was commissioned by the King of France, Louis XII to celebrate the birth of his only daughter Claude in 1499. The choice of subject would be adequate for such an occasion: Anne was the name of the King’s wife and St Anne is the patron saint of pregnant women and women trying to get pregnant. For unknown reasons the painting was not delivered to Louis XII, and observers noted that it was still in Leonardo’s workshop in 1517. The painting eventually ended up in the French royal collection: the first known record of [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] is the 1683 inventory of the Palace of Fontainebleau. While it is not definitive, it is most likely that King Francis I acquired the painting from Leonardo’s assistant, Salai.

The scene depicts three generations, St Anne, her daughter, the Virgin Mary and Jesus as an infant. From several preparatory works, it is evident that Leonardo devoted a lot of thought to the painting’s composition. [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] is closely tied to the large preparatory study, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-for-the-burlington-house-cartoon-the-virgin-and-child-with-st-anne-and-st-john-the-1][i]The Burlington House Cartoon[/i][/url] (ca. 1499-1500): unlike the study that depicts the young figure of Saint John the Baptist, the painting shows young Jesus playing with a lamb. The inclusion of the lamb, a symbol associated with the Passion, hints to Christ’s destiny. Leonardo gave particular significance to the figure of St Anne by making her the axis of the triangular composition. The religious scene is set in a fantastical mountainous landscape. Leonardo used atmospheric perspective to create the illusion of the distant mountains. He also employed the [i]sfumato[/i] technique, that softened the transition between colors, and gave the overall composition a delicate haziness.

[i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i] holds an important place in art history, influencing Leonardo’s contemporaries as well as subsequent generations of artists. Paintings such as Raphael’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-virgin-and-child-with-saint-john-the-baptist-1507][i]Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist[/i][/url] (1507) and Andrea del Sarto’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-sarto/charity][i]Charity[/i][/url] (1518) are examples of Leonardo’s profound influence on Renaissance artists. In the mid-19th century, the painting was hung in the Salon Carré at the Louvre, and was copied by many leading artists of the period like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Eugène Delacroix[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Édouard Manet[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-baptiste-carpeaux]Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux[/url]. The founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud also analyzed the painting in his essay [i]Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood[/i]. Freud’s interpretation inspired [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism#!#resultType:masonry]Surrealist[/url] artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst]Max Ernst[/url]. Ernst’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-ernst/the-kiss-1927][i]The Kiss[/i][/url] (1927), an homage to [i]The Virgin and Child with St. Anne[/i], emulated the pyramidal grouping, the embracing gesture and triangular composition of Leonardo’s painting."
Mona Lisa,da Vinci Leonardo,High Renaissance,portrait,"One of the most iconic and recognizable paintings in the world is the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] (ca. 1503-1519) painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The unique appeal of the portrait lies in its enigmatic nature, Mona Lisa’s smile radiates mystery, sensuality and contentment. This was achieved through sfumato, Leonardo’s painting technique that softened the transition between colors. This depth and complexity of expression is the reason the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] is regarded as the pinnacle of portraiture. The interest in the portrait was further amplified by its mysterious history: the identity of the sitter, who commissioned the painting, how long Leonardo worked on the portrait and how it entered the French royal collection are all topics of scholarly debate. 

It is thought that the sitter was Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. For this reason, the painting is sometimes called [i]La Gioconda[/i]. The earliest identification of the painting was provided by the Renaissance art historian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-vasari]Giorgio Vasari[/url]. In Vasari’s 1550 biography of Leonardo, he wrote about the magnificent portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, which Leonardo worked on between 1503 and 1506. Many were skeptical of Vasari’s account; however, a 2005 discovery at the University of Heidelberg provided compelling new evidence that confirms Vasari’s assertion. In a volume written by the ancient philosopher Cicero from 1477, there was a handwritten marginal by Leonardo’s contemporary, the secretary and assistant to Niccolò Machiavelli, Agostino Vespucci. In the note dated October 1503, Vespucci praises Leonardo’s skill by comparing him to the Greek and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], and states that Leonardo is working on a portrait of Lisa del Giacondo.

The [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was the earliest example in Italian portraiture that portrayed the sitter in a half-length format. Leonardo presented a new artistic formula: the figure is shown at half-length sitting in armchair in front of a [i]loggia[/i] - a gallery or room with one or more open sides. The incorporation of the [i]loggia[/i] allowed Leonardo to present an imaginary landscape as the backdrop of the portrait. This significant innovation influenced Leonardo contemporaries: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] adopted the composition and pose in his portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portrait-of-a-lady-with-a-unicorn-1506][i]Young Woman with Unicorn[/i][/url] (ca. 1506). Still it is important to note that Leonardo was indebted to Flemish portraiture of the second half of the 15th century, particularly the portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling]Hans Memling[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/barbara-de-vlaenderberch-1475][i]Portrait of Barbara van Vlaendenbergh[/i][/url] (ca. 1470-1472) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-memling/portrait-of-a-man-holding-a-coin-of-the-emperor-nero-1474][i]Man with a Roman coin[/i][/url] (ca. 1480).

Leonardo spent his final years in France, where his patron the King of France, Francis I, purchased [i]Mona Lisa[/i] for the royal French collection. From 1797, the portrait is on permanent display at the Louvre and is the crown jewel of the museum collection. On the morning of August 22 1911, Louvre employees were shocked to discover that the painting was stolen the previous night. Two years later, Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia was identified as the thief. Peruggia claimed his motives were patriotic: he believed Leonardo’s masterpiece belonged in Italy and was caught trying to sell the painting in Florence. After its discovery, the [i]Mona Lisa[/i] was exhibited throughout Italy before its celebratory return to the Louvre in 1914."
Women in the garden,Monet Claude,Impressionism,genre painting,"Monet’s technique of “en plein air” painting was hard at work on this painting. Because it necessitated that he work from the same point of view as he painted, he dug a trench for the bottom half of the painting to sit in while he painted the top, due to its large size (it measures 100 by 81 inches). His model for the women of the painting was Camille Doncieux, who would later become his wife, bearing him two sons. To finish the dresses in the most fashionable style, Monet used magazine illustrations to render the clothing."
Houses on the Achterzaan,Monet Claude,Impressionism,cityscape,"This light-filled, en plein air scene is one of twenty-four landscapes that Monet painted during his sojourn in the Netherlands in 1871. Painted near the village of Zaandam, the Achterzaan river occupies the foreground of the painting while windmills and industrial buildings can be seen in the distant background. The water reflects the multi-colored houses and willow trees that line the river bank as well as a white sail boat that floats along the water. A woman dressed in a white diaphanous gown stands beneath a willow tree on the left, gazing by the water. 

Employing a distinctly blonde color palette reminiscent of that used by landscape painter Corot, Monet renders this scene with attention to atmospheric detail and palpable light. This painting also evokes a sense of leisure and pastoral beauty typical of Dutch seventeenth century paintings that Monet would have seen during his stay in Holland. The artist’s color palette, portrayal of leisurely pursuits, and increasing attention to the surface of the canvas—all practices that Monet explored during his stay in Holland—were significant and influential in the development of his increasingly modern approach to painting.

Monet postdated this work, marking the canvas in his studio in the year after it was painted. The fact that Monet held on to the canvas for many years after he completed it contributes to the pristine condition of the unlined, unvarnished painting."
"Impression, sunrise",Monet Claude,Impressionism,cityscape,"When Impression, Sunrise hung at its first exhibition in 1874, art critic Louis Leroy derisively used the term “Impressionistic,” from the title of this painting, to describe Monet’s works. This term was quickly adopted by what were soon to be known as the Impressionist painters, and the exhibition which included other works by Impressionist artists, was from then on referred to as the “Impressionist Exhibition.” This painting was later stolen in 1985 from the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris, but was recovered undamaged in 1990, and was put back on display at the museum in 1991.

Ships in Harbor,Monet Claude,Impressionism,marina,"Most likely painted in 1873 at the port of Monet’s native Le Havre on the Normandy coast, this picture conjures an overcast day not with the expected palette of grays but with a range of blues, purples, greens, and muted pinks. These unblended pigments are laid down in parallel strokes to create the illusion of ripples in the water and the effect of masts backlit against the cloudy sky. Unblended strokes of color like these would become one of the hallmarks of Monet’s mature Impressionist style."
Camille Monet and a Child in the Artist’s Garden in Argenteuil,Monet Claude,Impressionism,portrait,"Camille, Monet's first wife, is shown with a child in the garden of their house in Argenteuil, near Paris, where they lived between 1872 and 1877. Today, Claude Monet is primarily known as a landscape painter, but in the beginning of his artistic career, he used to concentrate on portraits. No one else appeares in Monet's paintings as often as Camille. In those year, portraits of women were mostly ordered by bourgeois clients, but among progressive painters, the artistic structure became more important than the identity of the portrayed person. The masterly style, the lack of details, and the plainness of the colours led to a completely new directness of expression, independent of the facial gestures of the depicted person. In this picture, the shimmering reds, blues, greens, and white that capture the brilliance of a sun-drenched day are applied with many small brushstrokes, whose varied shapes create the different textures of flowers, grass, and clothing. Meanwhile, the features of the woman are completely indistinct."

Haystacks at Giverny,Monet Claude,Impressionism,landscape,"One of Monet’s series of paintings, Haystacks is a series of about 25 paintings, all depicting stacks of hay left in the field after harvesting. He began the paintings at the end of the summer of 1890, and continued until the next springs, using the harvests near his home in Giverny, France. Because of the repetitious subject matter, in this series Monet was not as concerned about the haystacks themselves as he was depicting the differences in light and color surrounding the haystacks in the different seasons, time of day, and weather. The paintings are now held in galleries, museums, and private collections around the world, and are some of his most notable works."
Poplars at Giverny,Monet Claude,Impressionism,landscape,"Another of Monet’s series of paintings, the Poplar paintings were painted in the summer and fall of 1891. The poplars trees were located on the banks of a river a few miles up the river from Monet’s home in Giverny, France, in a marsh. Monet had to reach his painting studio, which was floating outside along the bank of the trees, by going upriver in a small boat. The trees that were the subject of the paintings were actually put up for sale by the city of Limetz, who owned them, and Monet actually bought the trees so he could continue his paintings of them. After his series was finished, he sold the trees to a lumber company who wanted them for harvest."

Rouen Cathedral Façade and Tour d'Albane (Morning Effect),Monet Claude,Impressionism,cityscape,"Monet’s series paintings of the 1890s—multiple variations of a single motif conceived, executed, and exhibited as a group—are among his most inventive and remarkable works. In the winter of 1892 the artist spent several months studying and painting the façade of Rouen Cathedral in his native Normandy. From rooms facing the cathedral across a square, Monet concentrated on the analysis of light and its effects on the forms of the façade, changing from one canvas to another as the day progressed. Later he extensively reworked the thirty paintings of the cathedral series in his studio at Giverny. Their encrusted surfaces of dry, thickly layered paint evoke the rough texture of weathered stone, absorbing and reflecting light like the walls of the cathedral itself.

Water Lilies,Monet Claude,Impressionism,flower painting,"Monet’s Water Lilies series contained around 250 paintings, which he painted during the last thirty years of his life at his house in Giverny, France. Many of the paintings were completed while Monet was suffering from cataracts, which gave him a redder tone to his vision, which is represented in some of his paintings. He went through two surgeries in 1923 to remove his cataracts, which many have left his eyes more sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths, as he went back and repainted some of his water lilies with a bluer tone. Works from Monet’s Water Lilies series are now housed all over the world, and have sold at auction for almost $41 million."

Honey Is Sweeter Than Blood,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,landscape,"Dali's first surreal painting, ""Honey is Sweeter than Blood"", shows a marked progression away from Cubism toward the depiction of subconscious obsessions. Dali's preoccupations with decadence, death, and immortality returned repeatedly in future works. This painting was made between Dali's first visits to Paris where he was socializing with artists who would found the Surrealist movement. 
The location of the painting is unknows since 1973."
Un Chien Andalou (film still),Dali Salvador,Surrealism,photo,"One of the most acclaimed films in cinema history, [i]Un Chien Andalou[/i] (An Andalusian Dog) (1929) is a short silent surrealist film by Spanish director Luis Buñuel and artist Salvador Dalí. Following the principles of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url], the film does not have a narrative in the conventional sense. Instead, Dalí and Buñuel decided to string together a series of images that have no logical or rational continuity. Liberated from the demands of narrative structure, the disruptive and disorienting qualities of [i]Un Chien Andalou[/i] capture the experience of dreaming on the film screen. The movie retains a sort of structure though, mainly through the recurrence of the same characters. However, the connection between the various events is purposefully ambiguous. Dalí and Buñuel use title cards throughout the film: “Once Upon a Time”, “Eight Years Later”, “Around Three in the Morning” etc. Nevertheless, these do not provide organization or structure, rather they appear random and even confusing.

The opening scene of [i]Un Chien Andalou[/i] remains one of the most recognizable images of cinema history. A man played by Buñuel slowly brings a sharp razor and slices the eyes of the heroine. At the precise moment of cutting the eyeball, the film shifts to an image of a cloud slicing across the moon, before immediately after returning to the gruesome image of the sliced eye. In this way, the film builds metaphors and hidden associations between unconnected images: on the one hand a tranquil image of the moon, and on the other hand the violent slicing of the eye.

Dalí and Buñuel wrote the script for [i]Un Chien Andalou[/i] in February 1929 during Buñuel’s six-day stay at Dalí’s house in Catalonia. When conceiving the film, the authors were influenced by André Breton’s ideas on Surrealism and Sigmund Freud’s theories on psychoanalysis. Dalí and Buñuel made a strategic choice to premiere the film in Paris, which allowed them to reach a wider audience, one that they believed would be receptive to their ideas. This decision also reflected their belief about the universality of the language of cinema. Additionally, they believed that cinema as a medium has the directness and immediacy that can be particularly effective for representing unconscious processes, dreams, and desires.

[i]Un Chien Andalou[/i] premiered in Paris on June 6, 1929, and surpassed the expectations of its authors, who solidified their place in the French surrealist circle led by Breton. Even though the film remains enigmatic, generally it is understood as a work that deals with sexuality. This has prompted many readings of the film and scholars have connected the film to a range of subjects: homosexuality, the sexual transition from adolescence to adulthood, the threat sexual desire poses to male identity, and more.
In 1930, Dalí and Buñuel collaborated on the sequel and wrote together with the script for [i]L'Age d'Or[/i] (The Golden Age) (1930). Dalí and Buñuel fell out during the making of the film, but despite that, the film proved a critical and popular success. It also managed to agitate right-wing groups that attacked the cinema where the film was shown."
The Great Masturbator,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"[i]The Great Masturbator[/i] (1929) is an autobiographical painting, in which the artist addresses his anxieties, fears, and sexual obsessions. At the center of the painting is a large amorphous form that is a distorted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] of the artist: Dalí depicts himself with his eyes shut and a large grasshopper placed on his mouth. Similar versions of the self-portrait appear in Dalí’s other paintings including the famous masterpiece [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1931][i]The Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (1931). According to Dalí, he based the self-portrait on a rock formation in Cap de Creus, located along the shore of his homeland, Catalonia. Some scholars have also drawn a parallel between the self-portrait and a section of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-garden-of-earthly-delights-1515-7][i]The Garden of Earthly Delights[/i][/url] (1510-1515) – on the right side of the left panel Bosch depicts rocks, bushes, and small animals that resemble the profile with the prominent nose and long eyelashes.

The artist casts himself as “the great masturbator”, and his hidden desire manifests itself through the female figure that emerges from the nape of his neck. She is identified as Gala Éluard, Dalí’s muse, and future wife. Her head and mouth are next to the crotch of a standing male figure, that is only visible from the waist down and cut off at the knees. Dalí painted [i]The Great Masturbator[/i] in the later summer of 1929, at the early stages of his relationship with Gala, who at the time was still married to his friend and colleague, the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealist[/url] poet Paul Éluard. The painting expressed the artist’s anxieties about their relationship, both regarding the circumstances of their romance and his fear of being taken advantage of or swallowed up by Gala. Gala’s presence is ambiguous, she is both loved and feared. She represents the artist’s fear of castration and female sexuality, but also the potential to achieve spiritual and sexual liberation through this relationship.

The most threatening element of the painting is the grasshopper, which relates to Dalí’s childhood fear of insects. Dalí often wrote poems that accompanied his paintings, and in the poem for [i]The Great Masturbator[/i], he referred to the insect as a locust.  For Dalí, the fear of the grasshopper or the locust related to the idea of being swallowed up or consumed, which is likely why the grasshopper clings to the lower part of the face, in place of the mouth. According to one interpretation, the grasshopper serves as another representation of Gala. This claim is supported by another painting from the period, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/portrait-of-paul-eluard][i]Portrait of Paul Éluard[/i][/url] (1929).  He began the portrait while Gala was still with Éluard, but by the time he finished, she had left Éluard. The portrait shares several elements with [i]The Great Masturbator[/i]: the roaring lion, the profile portrait of Dalí, and most importantly the grasshopper. The grasshopper likely implies Gala’s presence, and in a similar way, it signifies Dalí’s anxieties regarding adultery and the implications of their relationship.
 
[i]The Great Masturbator[/i] remained in the artist’s personal collection. After his death, the painting was willed to the national collection of Spain, and today it is part of the Museo Reina Sofía collection in Madrid."
The Persistence of Memory,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"[i]The Persistence of Memory[/i] (1931) is one of the most iconic and recognizable paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. Frequently referenced in popular culture, the small canvas (24x33 cm) is sometimes known as “Melting Clocks”, “The Soft Watches” and “The Melting Watches”. The painting depicts a dreamworld in which common objects are deformed and displayed in a bizarre and irrational way: watches, solid and hard objects appear to be inexplicably limp and melting in the desolate landscape. Dalí paints his fantastical vision in a meticulous and realistic manner: he effortlessly integrates the real and the imaginary in order “to systemize confusion and thus to help discredit completely the world of reality”.
 
When asked about the limp watches, the artist compared their softness to overripe cheese saying that they show “the camembert of time”. The idea of rot and decay is most evident in the gold watch on the left, which is swarmed by ants. Ants, a common motif in Dalí’s art are usually linked to decay and death. He set the scene in a desolate landscape that was likely inspired by the landscape of his homeland, the Catalan coast. The influence of the Catalan landscape also appears in another element of the painting: the artist inserts himself into the scene in the form of a strange fleshy creature in the center of the painting. According to Dalí, the self-portrait was based on a rock formation at Cap de Creus in northeast Catalonia. Some scholars have also drawn a parallel between the self-portrait and a section of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-garden-of-earthly-delights-1515-7][i]The Garden of Earthly Delights[/i][/url] (1510-1515) – on the right side of the left panel Bosch depicts rocks, bushes, and small animals that resemble Dalí’s profile with the prominent nose and long eyelashes. Similar versions of this self-portrait appear in other paintings by Dalí like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-great-masturbator-1929][i]The Great Masturbator[/i][/url] (1929).
 
The melting watch, one of Dalí’s most powerful and potent motifs, continued to play an important role in his art. Two decades after [i]The Persistence of Memory[/i], Dalí recreated his famous work in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-disintegration-of-the-persistence-of-memory][i]The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (1952-1954). As the title suggests, the painting shows the disintegration of the world depicted in the original painting, reflecting a world changed by the nuclear age. The painting showed Dalí’s growing interest in quantum physics: he added rectangular blocks that represent “the atomic power source” and missile-like objects that reference the atomic bomb. In the late stages of his career, Dalí also produced numerous sculptures of melting watches including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1980][i]The Persistence of Memory[/i][/url] (ca. 1980), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/profile-of-time-1984][i]Profile of Time[/i][/url] (1977-1984), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/nobility-of-time-1984][i]Nobility of Time[/i][/url] (1977-1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/dance-of-time-i-1984][i]Dance of Time I[/i][/url] (1979-1984).
 
[i]The Persistence of Memory[/i] was first shown in 1932 at the [i]Julien Levy Gallery[/i] in New York. In 1934, the painting was anonymously donated to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it remains until this day."
Retrospective Bust of a Woman,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,sculpture,"Retrospective Bust of a Woman exemplifies Dali's found object sculptures in which the original materials would be recontextualized through a process of assembly and composition. This piece was constructed around an inkstand, atop which was placed a replica of figures from Jean-Francois Millet's painting The Angelus (1857-1859). Dali was fixated on this painting, deeming it a marvelous representation of sexual repression, which he worked compulsively to unleash. The necklace draped around the bust is made from a zoetrope strip, indicating the potential for movement in a still object as well as Dali's interest in film."
Soft Construction with Boiled Beans: Premonition of Civil War,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,allegorical painting,"This painting is an allegorical response to the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, but it is also a garish and gruesome depiction of a body destroying itself. Dali painted this work prior to General Franco's invasion, yet it predicts the violence, anxiety, and doom many Spaniards felt during Franco's later rule. Soft Construction with Boiled Beans is a fine example of a Dali composition that simultaneously expresses his sexual obsessions as well as his political outrage."
The Metamorphosis of Narcissus,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,mythological painting,"[i]Metamorphosis of Narcissus[/i] (1937) by Salvador Dalí is the artist’s interpretation of the Narcissus myth in Ovid’s [i]Metamorphoses[/i]. According to the myth, Narcissus was a beautiful youth courted by many suitors, who was too proud to love someone in return. After Narcissus rejected the nymph Echo, the goddess of revenge Nemesis decided to punish him for his vanity. One day Narcissus was bending down to drink when he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the clear pool of water. Overcome by strong feelings of love, he tried to embrace his own reflection and when he couldn’t he fell into despair, beating his chest until he died. In the same place, a beautiful flower bloomed, the narcissus.
 
Dalí’s interpretation of the myth departs from traditional depictions of Narcissus, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/narcissus][i]Narcissus[/i][/url] (c.1599) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicolas Poussin[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin/echo-and-narcissus-1630][i]Echo and Narcissus[/i][/url] (1627-1628). Rather than depicting a single moment, Dalí’s painting highlights the process of transformation. He depicted Narcissus in two modes. On the left, Narcissus is naked in a crouched position, his head is supported by his knee as he looks at his reflection, partially visible in the water. On the right, Narcissus is transformed into an ossified hand holding an egg, out of which a narcissus flower emerges. The motif of the hand holding an egg resembles the assemblage [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray/main-ray-1936][i]Main Ray[/i][/url] (1935) by fellow Surrealist artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray]Man Ray[/url], which depicts a hand holding a globe. Dalí substituted the globe with the egg, which can be linked to the artist’s interest in alchemy. In alchemy, the egg represents an ideal form that is associated with ‘immaculate conception’. The egg has opposite qualities, its exterior is cold and solid while its inner substance is warm and liquid. In the painting, he alludes to the two qualities of the egg: on the left Narcissus’s head painted in warm yolk tones resembles a chunk of raw material, while on the right it is white, hard and fossilized. The white egg represents purity, and out of this pure form, Narcissus is reborn as a flower.
 
Dalí began painting [i]Metamorphosis of Narcissus[/i] in the spring of 1937, while he was in Zürs, in the Austrian Alps. He also wrote a long poem that accompanied the painting. This was the first painting Dalí made completely in accordance with the [i]paranoiac-critical method[/i], a surrealist technique he developed in the 1930s. The technique required the artist to enter a unique state of mind which he described as a “spontaneous method of irrational knowledge, based on the critical-interpretative association of the phenomena of delirium”. It was particularly effective when creating an optical illusion, of one image hidden within another. In this way, Dalí was able to emphasize the passage of time, and the process of the metamorphosis.
 
While in London in 1938, the writer Stefan Zweig arranged a meeting between Dalí and the renowned psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Dalí, a great admirer of Freud, brought with him [i]Metamorphosis of Narcissus[/i] as an example of his work. The following day, Freud wrote to Zweig: “until now I was inclined to regard the Surrealists – who seem to have chosen me as their patron saint – as 100% mad (let’s say 95%, as with alcohol). This young Spaniard, with his ingenuous fanatical eyes and his undeniable technical mastery, has suggested to me a different appreciation. In fact, it would be very interesting to explore analytically the creation of such a painting.”"
The Burning Giraffe,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,allegorical painting,"Salvador Dali's painting, The Burning Giraffe, epitomises the surrealist style of painting he was renowned for.

The emergence of psychoanalysis and the work of Sigmund Freud were major influences on the artist, along with the cubist output of Picasso and the work of other surrealists, such as, Miro and classical painters,including Vermeer and Velazquez.

Those coming to Dali for the first time, most typically through the coloured plates in art books, are often surprised to find that the actual canvases and boards he committed his work to are much smaller than imagined. The Burning Giraffe is one such example.

The work dates from 1937 when Dali was 34 years old. It was painted in Spain, with oils on board, prior to Dali’s American sojourn in the early 1940s. The painting measures 35cm X 27cm and is currently housed in the Kunstmuseum in Basel Switzerland.

In 1937, Spain was in the grip of a bloody civil war and the painting is thought to represent both the insecurities the artist felt about that conflict, his struggles with his own country and his own deeper subconscious world of dreams, and perceptions. It is full of images that act almost as motifs which recur frequently in Dali’s work.

It is interesting that the title of the painting is The Burning Giraffe because this image, which is much smaller than the two female forms in the foreground, can only be seen, almost in relief, at the back of the picture as the eye moves back towards the horizon.

Dali first used the image of a burning Giraffe, which he called the masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster, in the film L’ Age d ‘Or (the Golden Age) which he made in collaboration with Luis Bunuel in 1930.

The image recurs again in a much later (1975) work in pastel and water colour, Burning Giraffes in Brown, also known as Giraffe Avignon. For many, the Giraffe works for Dali as a totem animal with the burning Giraffe seen as a premonition of war; whilst fire is representative of a dangerous death, imbued with meaning.

The breaking up of the female form and mystification surrounding female sexuality, combined with fetishism are themes common to Dali. Here the two main figures are clearly female, but they appear in almost skeletal form as what Dali called, the tail bone woman.

The skin appears to be peeling, exposing what lies beneath, hidden, one of the main ideas conveyed in this work. The figures stand in isolation from each other and from the rest of the painting, in a dream landscape which the artist has created by exceptional use of colour.

The figures are featureless, deprived of sight or hearing but the figure in the foreground is reaching out for something, perhaps symbolic of the position women had reached on their journey towards equality.

The drawer that opens out of the thorax, together with the seven small drawers that open from the left leg of the principle figure, make what Dali referred to as the anthropomorphic cabinet. This takes us back to Freud and the secret drawers in the human psyche which can only be opened through psychoanalysis.

From Dali's perspective this was about suppression of the inner and subconscious life, and the taming of inner beast.

Women are objectified and desired and this is repressed and the true self is hidden away because these things are not socially acceptable. And yet, Dali was aware of what he called, the narcissistic smells coming from the drawers which made it almost impossible to resist opening them.

Undefined shapes eminate from the backs of both of the female forms. Could these shapes be yet another of Dali’s favourite artistic devices, melting clocks, or soft watches as seen in perhaps his most famous work, The Persistence of Memory (1931)?

The smaller figure holds what appears to be a piece of flesh in her hand, a device also present in The Great Masturbator (1929). Raw meat is seen as the call for a return to primitive nature, a rediscovery of the inner being.

Both female forms are supported by crutches, yet another of Dali’s common motifs seen in many of his works, but perhaps best utilised in Sleep (1937) and less so in The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table (1934).

In The Burning Giraffe, the crutches are clearly masculine in nature, representing a patriarchal system which many believed women would be helpless without. They are phallic in essence, male dominance over the bodies of women."
Lobster Telephone,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,sculpture,"[i]Lobster Telephone[/i] (1936)  is a surrealist object, in which the artist combined items that are usually not associated with one another. The result is a strange new object, that is both humorous and threatening. For Dalí, these strange combinations revealed the hidden desires of the unconscious. Dalí was greatly influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud: concepts of dreams, childhood memories, castration anxiety, and incestuous desires all played significant roles in his art. With the help of Freudian thought, Dalí developed a unique visual language, through which he could express his personal fears and obsessions.

Telephones and lobsters were recurring motifs in Dalí’s art. The telephone appears in many of Dalí’s paintings from the 1930s, and it is usually accompanied by a food item: telephone and fish in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/mountain-lake][i]Mountain Lake[/i][/url] (1938), telephone and fried eggs in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-sublime-moment][i]The Sublime Moment[/i][/url] (1938) and telephone and oysters in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-enigma-of-hitler][i]The Enigma of Hitler[/i][/url] (1939). In [i]Lobster Telephone[/i] that was initially called [i]Aphrodisiac Telephone[/i], Dalí made a strong analogy between food and sex: the lobster is placed in such a way that its sexual organs cover the mouthpiece of the telephone. Lobsters along with food like oysters, caviar, and truffles were generally considered an aphrodisiac. However, the lobster can also be seen as menacing: according to one interpretation, the lobster with its small and sharp claws represents a symbolic instrument of castration. In 1939 the artist created a multimedia experience [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-dream-of-venus-for-the-new-york-world-s-fair-1939][i]The Dream of Venus for the New York World’s Fair[/i][/url] (1939), in which he dressed live nude models in garments made from fresh seafood. Dalí used the lobster to cover the female sex organs of his models, which possibly expressed his personal fears of female sexuality.

Dalí made [i]Lobster Telephone[/i] for Edward James, an English poet and leading collector of Surrealist art. This work, which belongs to the Tate Museum collection, is one of four models Dalí created for James. For the Tate version, Dalí used a telephone made by the Bell Company in Antwerp, Belgium, and a Siemens handset made in London. He made an additional series of six lobster telephones in shades of off-white like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/aphrodisiac-telephone-1938][i]Aphrodisiac Telephone[/i][/url] (1938) at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

The idea for the [i]Lobster Telephone[/i] traces back to a series of drawings Dalí made for American Weekly in 1935. One of the drawings, [i]New York Dream - Man Finds Lobster in Place of Phone[/i] shows a man reaching for the phone and realizing in horror that it is a lobster. In 1938, Dalí contributed an entry called [i]Téléphone Aphrodisiaque[/i] to the [i]Dictionnaire abrégé du surréalisme[/i] (Abridged Dictionary of Surrealism) with a drawing of a lobster telephone surrounded by flies. A similar drawing was featured in his autobiography [i]The Secret Life of Salvador Dali[/i] in which he wrote: “'I do not understand why, when I ask for a grilled lobster in a restaurant, I am never served a cooked telephone; I do not understand why champagne is always chilled and why on the other hand telephones, which are habitually so frightfully warm and disagreeably sticky to the touch, are not also put in silver buckets with crushed ice around them.”"
The Dream of Venus for the New York World’s Fair,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,installation,"Long before installation art was the norm, Salvador Dali created perhaps the first example at the 1939 World’s Fair that was held in Flushing Meadows in Queens, New York.

The 1939 World’s Fair sounds incredible. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Albert Einstein spoke, Vermeer’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-milkmaid][i]The Milkmaid[/i][/url] (c.1660) and the [i]Magna Carta[/i] were on display, Westinghouse buried a time capsule to be open in 6939 AD (some contents include writings by Einstein and Thomas Mann, a pack of Camel cigarettes, microfilm with texts, seeds, and a Mickey Mouse watch). The fair debuted color photography, nylon, air conditioning, the View-Master and Smell-o-Vision, and had “zones” debuted “future technologies” by companies like GM and Frigidaire.

Dali’s pavilion was entitled [i]Dream of Venus[/i], and it created a surrealist dream world. Patrons entered through a pair of women’s legs (John Malkovich copied this for his Lisbon Nightclub called [i]Lux[/i]) and purchased tickets from a fish head booth. Dali designed two pools where topless sirens and mermaids swam about, women dressed as pianos and lobsters cavorted amongst paintings and props in front of a giant four-paneled painting by Dali and other tableaus with costumes designed by Dali.

Sadly, creative compromise happened even then. The fair organizers made major modifications to Dali’s original ideas, which caused him to dramatically write a pamphlet called [i]Declaration of the Independence of the Imagination and the Rights of Man to His Own Madness[/i]. Although Dali wasn’t thoroughly satisfied, the exhibition brought [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url] and Dali’s creative ideas out of the artistic world and to the masses."
Ballerina in a Death's Head,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"This painting is an example of Dali’s paranoiac-critical method, developed in the early 1930s. The aspect of paranoia that Dalí was interested in was the ability of the brain to perceive links between things which rationally are not linked. Dalí described the paranoiac-critical method as a ""spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the critical and systematic objectivity of the associations and interpretations of delirious phenomena."" Employing the method when creating a work of art uses an active process of the mind to visualize images in the work and incorporate these into the final product. An example of the resulting work is a double image or multiple image in which an ambiguous image can be interpreted in different ways."
Young Virgin Auto-Sodomized by the Horns of Her Own Chastity,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"This painting documents Dali's interest in exaggerating the representation of the female form and the possibilities of an abstracted background. The main force within the painting is clearly its sexual allusion: the horned shapes hovering around the woman are overtly phallic, and the painting's title offers a direct clue about the aggressively sexual tone of the work. Dali's preoccupation with the phallus was a central theme throughout his career, though the degrees to which his works were representational or abstract differed period to period."
The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,landscape,"Dali repeated his theme of the melting watches many times, most notably in the 1950’s with The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory. Although it measures a small 10 by 13 inches, it is full of allusions to the first painting, albeit with a flooded landscape, depicting the changes in the landscape from both above and below the water. Whereas some interpretations of the first work claim that it represents Einstein’s theory of relativity, interpretations of this work state that it represents the newly emerging ideas of quantum mechanics and the coming of the digital age. Later in his career Dali also created many lithographs and sculptures with variants on the theme of soft watches."
The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,history painting,"One of a number of large paintings Dali completed in this era The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus stands a massive 14 feet tall by 9 feet wide. The painting was commissioned by Huntington Hartford, an American businessman, who was heir to the A&P Supermarket, for the opening of his museum, Gallery of Modern Art, in New York. The museum was located on Columbus circle, hence the inspiration for the subject of the painting. As a devout Roman Catholic, Dali portrayed Columbus as the Christian savior, bringing the true church and salvation to the new world. The painting now resides at the Salvador Dali Museum, in St. Petersburg, Florida."
"Lazarus, come forth - Lazare, veni foras (John 11:44)",Dali Salvador,"Abstract Expressionism, Symbolism",religious painting,"As with all of Dali's work, there is a dream-like quality here. His image of Lazarus appeals to the fear of death and decay within all living creatures, but has an energy that speaks of life as well. Dali is known for his use of symbolism, but there is not much that is symbolic in this picture. It is more impressionistic, suggesting as it does both death and life in a single image."
Antequam exhires de vulva sactificavite (Jeremiah 1:5),Dali Salvador,"Expressionism, Symbolism",religious painting,"The Biblia Sacra was based on the Holy Bible written in Latin Vulgate text, there are five volumes of a 105 lithographs taken from the original paintings that Dali completed between 1963 and 1964. The original illustrations were completed with a combination of gouache, watercolor, ink, and pastel and incorporated a wide variety of religious, historical and mythological imagery. They were intense both in color and in images. While the completed works earned Dali audiences with both Popes Pius XII and John XXIII, the search for the renewal of Dali's faith was ultimately unfulfilled."
Aliyah,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,abstract,"This Original Color Lithograph Edition: 178/250 on Paper is by Salvador Dali (1904-1989). It is part of the series of graphic work entitled Aliyah dates from 1968. The series was commissioned by Shorewood Publishers for the 20th anniversary of the state of Israel in 1967. The set is comprised of 25 mixed-media paintings highlighting important religious, historical and political moments in Jewish history. The series, called “Aliyah, the Rebirth of Israel,” received a special endorsement from Israel’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. Shorewood exhibited the original series in a New York museum, but each piece was then sold to private collectors. Their locations remain largely unknown. 250 sets of prints of the collection were made.
Dali did not have a connection to Judaism, but succeeded in grasping the connection between the Bible, the Jewish people and its history, and the land of Israel. Every painting is accompanied by a biblical verse ascribed to each work by the artist. Subjects range from broadly biblical to contemporary.
In order to illustrate the various meanings of the Hebrew word ""Aliyah"", which means literally ""migration to the land of Israel"", the artist took inspiration from the Old Testament as well as contemporary history. As usual in Dalí's work, the pieces also contain elements from his own iconography.
This particular lithograph depicts the Holocaust and is traced back to a Psalms 88:7 quotation: “Thou hast laid me in the nethermost pit, in dark places, in the deeps” This quotation from Psalms is fittingly used by Dali in his second distinctly Shoah lithograph. Note the mourning figure, the swastikas, the dead body, the blood, the seated figure in mourning that echoes many such Jeremiah-like images, and the Jewish Star of David."
Assuerus Falls in Love with Esther - Assueres adamavit Esther (Esther 2:17),Dali Salvador,"Expressionism, Symbolism",religious painting,"Dali was profoundly influenced by two things that shaped his art and his approach to life: Freud's theory of the Unconscious, and the unconscious dream imagery of Surrealism. His paintings (and lithographs) appear as dreamlike fantasies - as this image clearly shows. At the same time, the technique he used was precise, realistic and highly skilled. In this lithograph a dream-like Esther has taken up residence in the mind of Ahasuerus, floating there, occupying all his thoughts - and in a sense trapped there."
The Hallucinogenic Toreador,Dali Salvador,"Neoclassicism, Surrealism",symbolic painting,"Dali illustrates his passion for bullfighting in The Hallucinogenic Toreador, his wife Gala, however, did not. Her face is pictured in the top left corner of the piece, with a look of condemnation, illustrating her hatred for the practice. The statue of Venus de Milo is seen 28 times in the painting, which is not an innocuous addition. In order to see the face of the toreador, you must look past the first illustration of the statue. The face lies in the second Venus de Milo. Upon closer inspection, the breasts of the statue make up the nose of the bullfighter, and their dresses make up his red scarf, and white shirt, tied with a green necktie. When the painting was first exhibited in New York City, it was accompanied by an illustration labeled “how to see the toreador,” which gave explicit instructions on how to see the hidden image of the toreador in the painting."
Hitler Masturbating,Dali Salvador,Surrealism,genre painting,"The title and the content of the work suggest a sort of self-parody, which makes sense considering the late period in Dali’s life during which the painting created.  Though Dali generally worked in oil, Hitler Masturbating is a watercolor. Given the looser nature of the medium, it was likely executed more quickly than the majority of Dali’s canon.  It also represents a departure from the fabricated automatism of Dali’s meticulous photorealism.  The brushstrokes are looser and the landscape more impressionistic.  The painting depicts exactly what the title suggests; the dictator, in full Nazi uniform, sits in an armchair, his back to the viewer amidst a barren snowscape.  His chair appears to morph into a group of horses, the hooves of which still bear resemblance to the chair.  The image evokes Dali’s 1942 watercolor Sheep, in which a herd of sheep have their hooves inexplicably replaced by gilded furniture legs.  The transformation from chair to horse evokes the journey of the retired soldier, once on horseback, now on plaid.  It could be argued that the painting is an attempt on Dali’s part to humanize Hitler. By depicting him from behind, Dali renders him anonymous, simply a figure engaged in an intensely private yet ubiquitous act.  Given Dali’s sense of humor, however, the painting is more likely a dirty joke on Dali’s part.  As Hitler masturbates, he looks upon a barren wasteland, an emptiness that resembles the destruction of Europe by his own hand."
The Swallow's Tail,Dali Salvador,"Abstract Art, Surrealism",figurative,"The Swallow’s Tail completed in the spring in 1983, the last in a series based of paintings based on catastrophe theory, and was Salvador Dali’s last painting. Catastrophe theory, based on the thinkings of Rene Thom, posited that there are seven equilibrium surfaces: fold, cusp, swallowtail, butterfly, hyperbolic umbilic, elliptic umbilic, and parabolic umbilic. Dali incorporated each one of these surfaces into his painting, alongside the gentle and elegant curves of the cello. Set against a gentle blue background, the painting is more than just a series of shapes and curves; it is a precise representation of Dali’s understanding of and interest in mathematical theory."
The rich fool,Rembrandt,"Baroque, Tenebrism",religious painting,"Rembrandt illustrates the parable of the rich fool, as told in Luke 12. At night a rich man studies one of his golden coins.

In the early 17th century a stack of books was often used as a symbol of vanity. The Hebrew letters suggest a biblical setting.

The usual interpretation of the parable is that there is no point in spending a life gathering wealth. After all, onced you die money is of no use. It might even get into the hands of people who do not deserve it. It is therefore thought to be wiser to be ""rich toward God"".

The alternative title is ""The Money Changer""."
The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp,Rembrandt,Baroque,genre painting,"This iconic painting shows Dr. Tulp providing an anatomy lesson, as the forceps in his right hand lift a tendon from the partially dissected arm of a man who had been executed for armed robbery earlier that morning. Tulp looks toward the seven men gathered around the corpse as his left hand gestures to explain an anatomical point. The men, their white collars and fine clothes indicating their wealth, look in various directions. The three closest to the center lean forward as if watching Tulp's hands, while the two in the back look out toward the viewer. The two on the far left, depicted in profile, face toward Tulp but seem to be looking beyond him, outside the picture frame. A sense of dynamic movement and psychological complexity results, as no one returns Tulp's gaze or looks directly at the pale corpse. The umbra mortis, or shadow of death, fills the center of the canvas. The man's body, his genitals covered with a piece of white linen, evokes the iconography of Christ's death, though here, the body is forgotten, at the same time his dissected arm grimly conveys death's reality.

In this work, Rembrandt innovatively transformed group portraiture by dramatically focusing on the event in mid-action, rather than merely presenting a posed scene. As a result the work becomes a mise-en-scene, a kind of graphic documentary, and a masterful portrait.

The Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons commissioned the group portrait, Rembrandt's first important one in the city. The men attended the Guild's annual public dissection in 1632 at which Dr. Tulp, the City Anatomist, presided. In 17th century Holland, anatomical lessons were noted social events, accompanied by music, conversation, and food and wine, taking place in theater lecture rooms, and attended by those who could afford the entrance fee. The well-dressed appearance of these men, their white collars and fine gowns, testify to their social importance, and yet, they are presented as if both sensationalized and distracted, their humanity overshadowing their status.

Manet painted a copy of this painting in 1856 after studying it on a trip to the Netherlands, and the American realist Thomas Eakins was also influenced by it in painting his The Gross Clinic (1875). The executed man Kindt has also taken on a kind of later cultural life, referred to in W. G. Sebald's The Rings of Saturn (1999) and in Nina Siegal's The Anatomy Lesson (2014), which tells his story."
The Storm on the Sea of Galilee,Rembrandt,Baroque,religious painting,"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee is the only seascape ever painted by Rembrandt. It depicts Jesus calming the waves of the sea, saving the lives of the fourteen men aboard the vessel. Of these fourteen men, it is said Rembrandt included a self portrait of himself in the boat, next to Jesus and his twelve disciples. On March 18, 1990, the painting was stolen by thieves disguised as police officers. They broke into the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, and stole this painting, along with twelve other works. The paintings have never been recovered, and it is considered the biggest art theft in history. The empty frames of the paintings still hang in their original location, waiting to be recovered."
Flora,Rembrandt,Baroque,portrait,"Rembrandt painted his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh as Flora, goddess of spring and flowers, three times: in 1634,1635 and 1641. In this work he combined elements of pastoral and historical portraits. Created in the year of their marriage, this painting shows the love and admiration the artist felt for the young woman. The contrast between the young sitter's diffident pose and the sumptuousness of her richly embroidered clothes and accessories gives the image a special charm."
Belshazzar's Feast,Rembrandt,Baroque,religious painting,"Rembrandt based this painting off of the story of Belshazzar as well as the writing on the wall in Book of Daniel in the Old Testament. Although Amsterdam was part of the Holy Roman Empire at the time, it also had a large Jewish population, and so this is a story of which many of Rembrant’s contemporaries would have been familiar. The artist’s intention at the time was to create a portrait of a religious story to which the public, who were largely illiterate, could refer. Rembrandt produced many stories from the bible for the same purpose, including Return of the Prodigal Son and Christ with the Sick around Him."
The Nightwatch,Rembrandt,"Baroque, Tenebrism",genre painting,"The best known work by Rembrandt, this painting resides at the State Museum in Amsterdam, where it is lauded as one of the most famous paintings in the world. For much of its history, the painting was covered with a thick layer of varnish, giving the impression that it was a night scene, hence the name. The varnish was removed in 1940, revealing the bright colors of the painting. The painting has also suffered damage at the hand of art dealers, who in 1715 cut the painting down on three side on order to fit it between two columns, and vandals, who have purposely tried to ruin the painting. In 1975, an unemployed school teacher attacked the work, leaving a large section of zig-zags scratches. The painting was successfully restored, although the scratches are still somewhat visible. In 1990, the painting was attacked again, by a man who threw acid on the canvas. The acid was quickly neutralized, however, and the painting was saved."
Danae,Rembrandt,Baroque,mythological painting,"This painting depicts the mythical character of Danae, welcoming Zeus into her bed, and who later bore his son, Perseus. Rembrandt originally used his first wife, Saskia, as the model in the painting, but later replaced her face with the face of his mistress Geertje Dircx. In 1985, a man threw acid on the painting as it hung on display at the Hermitage Museum. He also cut the canvas twice with a knife. The most badly damaged parts of the painting were to the face and hair of Danae, her right arm, and her legs. The entire middle section of the painting was also dripping with a conglomeration of paint spots. Restoration of the painting began the same day, and was finished twelve years later. Then man who threw the acid was later declared insane."
Aristotle with a Bust of Homer (Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer),Rembrandt,"Baroque, Tenebrism","portrait, history painting","This picture was painted in 1653 for the Sicilian nobleman Don Antonio Ruffo (1610/11–1678) and sent from Amsterdam to his palace in Messina during the summer of 1654. Later Ruffo also ordered companion paintings from Rembrandt. They are the Alexander the Great of 1661 (now lost) and the fragmentary Homer (Mauritshuis, The Hague), dated 1663."
Bathsheba at Her Bath (Bathsheba Holding King David's Letter),Rembrandt,Baroque,religious painting,"Also called Bathsheba with King David's Letter, this painting depicts Bathsheba nude at her bath while she pensively ponders the King's letter in her right hand. The rich colors, the copper and gold draperies in the background, echoed by the gleaming gold of Bathsheba's jewelry emphasize the luminous glow of her nude body. The use of chiaroscuro seen in the white linen contrasting with the dark background and the highlights of her skin contrasting with the fabric's softly shadowed folds creates a sensual presence. The body here is almost palpable, drawing the viewer's eye. The painting is based upon the Biblical account of how King David, having seen Bathsheba bathing, commanded her to come to his palace, even though she was married to one of his generals, Uriah. When she obeyed and became pregnant as a result, David had her husband sent into the front lines of battle to be killed so that he could marry her. Subsequently, their child was stillborn, and David, realizing his sinfulness, did penance sitting in rags and ashes at the city's gate for a year. For the religious viewers of the time, the familiar Biblical story would have added a sense of fateful foreshadowing to the moment depicted here, as if Bathsheba were pondering not only her moral and personal dilemma, but also what would follow. The maidservant, kneeling at left to wash her foot, has her gaze discreetly lowered in darkness, as if aware of what the letter means.

Going against the current of his time, Rembrandt was the only great artist of the nude in the Dutch Golden Age, though he transfigured the genre by, as Simon Schama noted, creating ""the first depiction of a woman thinking."" The model for this painting is thought to be Hendrickje Stoffels, Rembrandt's life companion, though that attribution continues to be debated. Nonetheless, the work conveys intimacy of presence and of thought.

This work influenced Manet's The Surprised Nymph (1859-1861), Degas' Women Having Her Hair Combed (c. 1885), Frédéric Bazille's La Toilette (1870), and Picasso's Seated Nude and Another Figure (1963). Picasso was particularly influenced by Rembrandt, whom he took for a kind of alter ego, saying ""every painter takes himself for Rembrandt."""
St. Bartholomew,Rembrandt,Baroque,religious painting,"Artist: Rembrandt van Rijn (born Leiden 1606 - died Amsterdam 1669).
""The subject of this large, dramatic painting from the artist's mature period is Saint Bartholomew, one of the twelve apostles. The apostle, flayed alive for his beliefs, holds in his right hand a butcher's knife, a symbol of his martyrdom. The saint's slightly unsettled pose and expression of deep thought suggest that he is contemplating his own demise. Rembrandt conveys a mood of introspection in his late works-in contrast to his earlier, more theatrical pictures-and renders light, textures, and the sense of form in space with complex schemes of loose brushwork and glazes.""

Self-portrait,Rembrandt,"Baroque, Tenebrism",self-portrait,"This self-portrait depicts the artist, wearing a beret and a fine coat with upturned collar, his body in three quarter profile view, as he faces the viewer with a complex gaze. His slightly furrowed brow and deep-set eyes convey resolute strength and intensity, while the light, illuminating his face in rich variations of flesh tones with touches of pink, evokes vitality. The painting is strongly composed, his form a pyramid emphasized by the glow upon his left shoulder and his lit up clasped hands, rendered somewhat impressionistically. The brown background, though dark, is atmospherically rich and varied and counterpoints the darker tones of his coat. He seems to be surrounded by a kind of gravity that both emphasizes his illuminated face and adds an air of dignity.

Rembrandt had come to near financial ruin in 1659, as the previous year his house and possessions had been auctioned to pay his creditors, and the brooding quality of this work while reflecting, perhaps, the profound self-assessment that followed, is simultaneously a statement of artistic mastery. In 1639 Rembrandt encountered Raphael's Balthasar Castiglione (1514-1515), a noted portrait of the Humanist scholar, known as an ideal representative of High Renaissance ""nonchalant mastery."" Subsequently, Rembrandt made several sketches of the work, as well as an etching Self-portrait Leaning on a Stone Sill (1639), portraying himself in a similar pose, wearing a similar, but more contemporary, beret and dark clothing. This work becomes, in effect, Rembrandt's reply to the High Renaissance.

Rembrandt was the Dutch Golden Age's greatest portraitist, and almost modern in his emphasis on self-portraits, painted continually throughout his career. He influenced van Gogh and Rodin and had a noted impact on the 20th century influencing Frank Auerbach, who praised what he called the artist's ""raw truth,"" and Francis Bacon. As art historian Pilar Ordovas noted, ""Rembrandt was crucial to Bacon in terms of mark-making and the handling of paint."" In this late work, his brushwork is loose and almost Impressionistic, as art critic Mark Hudson wrote, ""Yet it is also the trajectory we expect art to take: away from tightness, order and control, towards expressivity and abstraction. As Rembrandt invents himself in paint, so he invents Modern Art as he goes."""
The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis,Rembrandt,Baroque,genre painting,"The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis was originally the largest painting ever created by Rembrandt, in the shape of a lunette, or a vertical rectangle with a round cornice on the top. The painting was originally commissioned by the city of Amsterdam for the town hall. However, the Amsterdam council rejected the painting and returned it to the artist, and it is still unknown as to whether or not he was ever paid for the work. After he received the painting back, Rembrandt cut the canvas down to a quarter of its original size, in order to sell the painting."
The Beethoven Frieze: The Hostile Powers. Far Wall,Klimt Gustav,Art Nouveau (Modern),allegorical painting,"This painting, created for the Vienna Secession exhibition of 1914, was intended to be a celebration of the great composer Ludwig von Beethoven. As it was meant solely for the exhibition, Klimt painted the mural lightly on the walls at the Vienna Secession Building. After the exhibition, the painting was preserved, but it was not again displayed until 1986, where it remains on display today. The mural’s popularity has cemented its fame as portions of it were printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin in 2004. The coin contains less suggestive elements of the painting, including a knight in armor symbolizing strength, a woman holding a wreath of victory symbolizing ambition, and a woman with head held down and clasped hands, symbolizing sympathy."

"University of Vienna Ceiling Paintings (Medicine), detail showing Hygieia",Klimt Gustav,Art Nouveau (Modern),allegorical painting,"In 1894, Klimt was commissioned to paint the ceilings in the University of Vienna’s great hall. The commission included three paintings, Philosophy, Medicine, and Jurisprudence. When Klimt presented them to the university upon completion, they were determined to be pornographic in nature, and filled with “perverted excess.” The university would not display them. Medicine was the second painting in the series, and depicted the river of life, and the continuity of life and death, and had no allusions to medicine or the science of healing. Because of this, he was attacked by critics, who pointed out that Vienna at the time was engaging in major medical advancements, and that the painting did not depict anything about either prevention or cure. In 1945, the paintings were destroyed in Germany by advancing forces, the only remaining portions being a photograph of a portion of Medicine, and certain drawings and preliminary sketches."
Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I,Klimt Gustav,Art Nouveau (Modern),portrait,"This painting, which took three years to complete, was commissioned by the wealthy industrialist Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who made his money in the sugar industry. Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer favored the arts, especially Klimt, and commissioned him to complete another portrait of his wife Adele in 1912. Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 million dollars, which at that time was the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York."
Danae,Klimt Gustav,Art Nouveau (Modern),mythological painting,"This painting is a typical representation of Klimt’s stylized eroticism, and portrays the subject of Danae, which has been a popular theme throughout painting, having been painted before by Corregio, Rembrandt, and Titian. Danae was the symbol of divine love, transcendence, and sensational beauty. By positioning the model with a raised leg, this painting pays tribute to the Titian series of paintings by the same name. As the story goes, while Danae was imprisoned by her father, she was visited by Zeus, in the form of the golden rain flowing between her legs. Soon after Zeus’ visit, Danae became pregnant and gave birth to her son Perseus."
The Kiss,Klimt Gustav,Art Nouveau (Modern),genre painting,"The Kiss is probably Gustav Klimt’s most famous work. It is also the high point of the artist’s Gold Period, which was characterized by his use of gold leaf in his work. This painting is one in which Klimt deviated from his portrayal of dominant in women in the form of a femme fatale. Instead is the portrayal of love and art, a couple locked in a golden-flecked, flower-filled embrace. Klimt was a man with an unbridled sexual appetite, as he fathered at least 14 illegitimate children. It is rumored that Klimt and his longtime companion, Emile Floge, who was also said to be his lover, were the models of the painting, which was selected to be printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin, minted in 2003."
A Modern Olympia,Cezanne Paul,Impressionism,genre painting,"[i]A Modern Olympia[/i] (1874) by Paul Cézanne was an homage to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Édouard Manet[/url]’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) that caused a great scandal when it was first exhibited at the 1865 Paris Salon. Manet’s Olympia shows a nude woman lying on the bed while a servant brings her flowers. It was modeled after the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/venus-of-urbino-1538][i]Venus of Urbino[/i][/url] (ca. 1534) by [url href=www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]. However, Manet’s [i]Olympia[/i] was not a Roman goddess, and a contemporary audience was able to unequivocally identify her as a prostituted woman. In the 19th century Paris ‘Olympia’ was a slang word for 'prostitute', and Manet revealed his model’s identity through several details in the painting: the contemporary accessories symbolized wealth and sensuality, the black cat was a symbol of prostitution and above all the gaze of the model confronted the viewer directly. The painting broke with academic tradition and convention by rejecting the idealized nude that represented historical or mythical figures. Despite the controversy, [i]Olympia[/i] was greatly admired by artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet]Claude Monet[/url] and Paul Cézanne, as well as by writer Émile Zola.

The idea for [i]A Modern Olympia[/i] came about during Cézanne’s stay with Doctor Paul Gachet at Auvers-sur-Oise. Cézanne had a burst of inspiration amid a heated discussion, during which he sketched out the adaptation of Manet’s painting. In the painting, Cézanne used luminous and bright colors and was painted in an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] manner. Cézanne’s interpretation [i]A Modern Olympia[/i] was exhibited in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and was poorly received by both the public and critics. In an art review, critic Marc de Montifaud wrote: “like a voluptuous vision, this artificial corner of paradise has left even the most courageous gasping for breath … and Mr. Cézanne merely gives the impression of being a sort of madman, painting in a state of delirium tremens”. 

Even though Cézanne included all the main elements of Manet’s painting, the nude woman, a black servant, a curtain, a large bouquet of flowers, and a small pet, the result was very different. Cézanne also made an important addition to the composition, a male figure reclining on the couch dressed in black, elegant attire. By restaging the scene Cézanne made it more explicit: the black maid uncovers the nude woman like in peep show designed for the client, the man on the couch. The gesture of the reveal is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome]Jean-Léon Gérôme[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-leon-gerome/phryne-before-the-areopagus-1861][i]Phryne before the Areopagus[/i][/url] (1861), a painting that depicts the trial of Phryne, a legendary courtesan from ancient Greece. Another important difference was in Cézanne’s depiction of Olympia: lying on the bed in a crouched pose, she has no recognizable facial features or characteristics. Painted crudely, Cézanne’s ‘modern Olympia’ is an archetypal figure, that does not possess the erotic appeal of Manet’s female nude. The erotic quality of Cézanne’s painting comes from the unseemly activity he explicitly depicts, rather than the sensuous flesh of the naked woman. Cézanne’s painting is theatrical, the curtain on the left side makes the scene appear like a moment captured on the stage. Today, [i]Olympia[/i] and [i]A Modern Olympia[/i] both belong to the collection of Musée d'Orsay in Paris."
Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley,Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,landscape,"Throughout his life,  Paul Cézanne painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_landscape,resultType:masonry]more then 200 landscapes[/url]. One of his favorite subjects was the limestone peak of Mont Sainte-Victoire in Provence in southern France. The artist had a special connection to the landscape, as Mont Sainte-Victoire was located near his hometown, Aix-en-Provence. Cézanne spent significant portions of his adult life in Aix-en-Provence, and he painted the local landscape at different stages of his career. In 1897, he settled permanently in Aix-en-Provence and lived there until he died in 1906. In his landscapes, Cézanne aimed to reveal the inner geometry of nature, saying he wanted “to make of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionism[/url] something solid and durable, like the art of museums”.

[i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i] (1882-1885) is an early example of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Series_mont-sainte-victoire,resultType:masonry][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i] series[/url], which shows the mountain rising above the Arc River Valley. The scene was likely painted from his sister’s property at the top of the hill behind her house. Cézanne included details of the property, as well as the walls, fields, and neighboring farmhouses. Another important element is the railroad viaduct with a moving train on the bridge. Cutting through the landscape, the railroad viaduct resembles a Roman aqueduct and recalls the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicolas Poussin[/url], like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin/the-finding-of-moses-1638][i]The Finding of Moses[/i][/url] (1638). In a letter, Cézanne wrote to a friend and writer Émile Zola, dated April 14, 1878, he described the train passing through the railway bridge at Arc River Valley as a “beautiful motif”. He included architectural elements to enhance the landscape and to contrast between the natural landscape and the manmade environment.

In early paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire, elements like trees and foliage were used to frame or break up the composition. In [i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i], the trees in the center interrupt the composition, while in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/mont-sainte-victoire-with-large-pine-1887][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire with Large Pine[/i][/url] (c. 1887) the tree on the left frames the composition. Creating the contrast between the mountain and the trees in the foreground, Cézanne explored different ways of making Mont Sainte-Victoire the focal point of the composition. In later paintings, Cézanne removed these elements, and in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/mont-sainte-victoire-1906-5][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i][/url] (c.1902-1906) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/mont-sainte-victoire-1906-4][i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i][/url] (c.1904-1906) the mountain dominates the landscape. The later paintings also had a limited palette of green, blue, grey, and cream, that emphasized the grandeur of the landscape.

Cézanne’s landscapes were also influenced by Japanese art, and there are certain parallels between his [i]Mont Sainte-Victoire[/i] series and the landscapes of Mount Fuji by artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Katsushika Hokusai[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hiroshige]Utagawa Hiroshige[/url]. The composition of [i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i] resembles Hokusai’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/lake-suwa-in-the-shinano-province][i]Lake Suwa in Shinano Province[/i][/url] (c.1829-1833) that depicts trees in the center with Mount Fiji in the distance.

[i]Mont Sainte-Victoire and the Viaduct of the Arc River Valley[/i] was owned by American industrialist Henry Osborne Havemeyer and his wife Louisine Havemeyer. The couple were avid art patrons and collectors and were among the first to bring Impressionist and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] art to America. After Henry Osborne Havemeyer died in 1907, the painting was passed on to his wife, who donated it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after her death in 1929."
Still life with basket (Kitchen table),Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,still life,"[i]Kitchen table (Still-life with basket)[/i] (1888-1890) is an intricate still life composition painted. It depicts pots, fruits, a basket, and cloth, all assembled on a kitchen table. Every component of the painting is carefully arranged and calculated: the artist pushes the table and cloth close to the viewer and crops them at the bottom of the canvas. The tabletop appears impossibly tilted, and some of the pots seem to be unstable on the table surface. For instance, both the grey pot and the basket have no more surface left on the tabletop. Similarly, the table, the cupboard, and the chair that line up diagonally on the left, all have a distorted sense of perspective. These distortions demonstrate how Cézanne’s principal concern was geometric form and color, rather than an accurate representation of reality. By painting objects like the grey pot from several viewpoints, simultaneously from above and the front, Cézanne wanted to represent a more profound truth that could be presented in painting but not in reality.

Cézanne achieves harmony through the color scheme: the fruits are painted in brilliant tones of red, green, and yellow. He contrasts the warm hues of the wood and the cane with the cooler tones of white, grey, and purple that are visible in the cloth and the ceramic dishes. The artist accentuated the rounded shape of the fruit, by repeating the circular shape in the loop of the grey pot, the basket handle, and in the handle of the coffee pot. There is also repetition in the floral motif in multiple details: the floral decoration on the china coffee jug, the round pot, and the flower painting on the wall.

[i]Kitchen table (Still-life with basket[/i]) is one of many masterful examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_still-life,resultType:masonry]Cézanne’s still lifes[/url], which are a significant portion of his body of work. Throughout his life, he painted nearly 200 still lifes, that mainly focused on simple household objects. In painting one still life after another, Cézanne continuously explored the relation of the objects in the composition, striving to find harmony and balance in form and color. To achieve this, he rearranged the different objects in his studio into new compositions, painting them at times from multiple viewpoints.

He was particularly fond of painting fruit and found beauty in their rich colors and basic shape. He explained to a friend: “they [fruits] love having their portraits done... They exhale their message with their scent. They reach you with all their smells and tell you about the fields they’ve left, the rain that made them grow, the dawns they watched. When I’m outlining the skin of a lovely peach with soft touches of paint or a sad old apple, I catch a glimpse in the reflections they exchange of . . . the same love of the sun, the same recollection of the dew, a freshness.” In still lifes like [i]Kitchen table (Still-life with basket)[/i], Cézanne had the ambitious goal of creating a monumental painting of everyday objects. He stated: “I shall astonish Paris with an apple”."
The Card Players,Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,genre painting,"In his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Period_final-period,resultType:masonry]final period[/url] in the early 1890s, Paul Cézanne created a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Series_card-players,resultType:masonry]series[/url] of five oil paintings that depicted the subject of card players. [i]The Card Players[/i] (1890-1892) at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, is the largest and the most elaborate painting of the series. The Barnes version is a five-figure composition and the only one that includes the figure of the young boy who observes the card game. A more condensed version of this painting is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/the-card-players-1893][i]The Card Players[/i][/url] (1890-1892) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, that has only four figures and a less detailed background. The other three paintings in the series are two-figure compositions, depicting two card players sitting opposite each other.

It was generally assumed that Cézanne first worked on the multi-figure paintings and then moved on to the simpler compositions featuring only two card players. However, recent technical examinations of the canvases indicate that the opposite was true. Scans revealed that the Metropolitan version was extensively reworked, much more than the larger canvas (135.3 x 181.9) in the Barnes Foundation. Therefore, it seems more likely that Cézanne expanded the composition, adding more figures and elements as he painted the series. Cézanne carefully crafted each painting, basing them on multiple preparatory sketches and figure studies he made of local farmers. For example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/man-with-a-pipe-study-for-the-card-players-1890][i]Man with a Pipe (Study for The Card Players)[/i][/url] (1890-1892) was a study of the figure leaning against the wall in the paintings from the Barnes Foundation and the Metropolitan Museum.

The series was the artist’s chief contribution to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting]genre painting[/url] – a genre that focused on everyday life, depicting people engaged in mundane activities. Cézanne adopted the motif of card players from 17th century Dutch and French genre paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen/card-players][i]Card Players in an Interior[/i][/url] (c. 1660) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jan-steen]Jan Steen[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers/card-players][i]The Card Players (Les joueurs de cartes)[/i][/url] (c. 1635-1640) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/le-nain-brothers]Le Nain brothers[/url]. In comparison to his predecessors, Cézanne’s paintings lack drama and narrative. Instead, his paintings have a simple setting with subdued figures smoking their pipes and playing cards. Cézanne’s card players show little expression, appearing passive and reserved or immersed in their respective tasks. The artist also limited the facial expressions of the players: their facial features were usually painted in a few strokes that marked their shadowed or downcast eyes.

Art historians also suggest that Cézanne’s composition was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] masters. Possible prototypes include [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/supper-at-emmaus][i]Supper at Emmaus[/i][/url] (c. 1530) and a lost painting by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-bellini]Giovanni Bellini[/url] of the same subject (c. 1490), that is known through copies and engravings. Similarly, Cézanne used the arrangement of the elements below the tabletop to create a counterpoint to the figures in the composition. This could also reflect the artist’s desire to enhance the everyday scene of card players with the monumentality of a religious subject. Others suggest that Cézanne treated [i]The Card Players[/i] like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_still-life,resultType:masonry]his still life paintings[/url], animating the surface with sequences of color contrasts, that alternate between light and dark, warm and cool hues. In the Barnes version, this is evident in details like the patterned tabletop that is formed through the color contrast between light blue and deep shades of red and violet."
Woman in a Green Hat (Madame Cezanne),Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,portrait,"Unlike many other artists of his period, who painted in only one area of composition, Cezanne was adept at many areas of composition, including landscapes, still lifes, nude studies, and portraits. The artist completed many portraits, often using models from real life as his guides, this one possibly being his wife. He employed a light style that was related to his direct observation of his subject, as indicated by the lightly amused look on her face and her engaged posture. This painting is also indicative of his use of small color planes. Rather than completing the painting with realistic depth and shadow, he illustrates the figure as if she is in a singular dimension, employing the use of one color for each area of the composition."
Mont Sainte-Victoire,Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,landscape,"This painting is of the landscape from Cezanne’s home in Aix-en-Provence, where he spent many of his later years painting. He developed a special relationship with this landscape and painted many rendition of it, especially the mountain in the background. The painting clearly illustrates the way Cezanne sought to depict the nature of reality and our perception of it. The mountain gives way to simple forms and the building in the foreground have been devolved into their particular shapes, all the while keeping the entirety of the landscape intact. Cezanne’s use of light and color give the impression that it is not his rendering of the landscape that give it a fragmented quality, but that it is an inherent quality of the landscape itself."
Basket of Apples,Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,still life,"This painting is most notable for the disjointment of perspective, as if the two sides of the painting were completed using two different points of view. The right side of the table is not in the same plane as the left side of the table, which was a stylized method used by Cezanne to incorporate the differences of viewpoint into an impressionistic still life. It was this technique that made it possible to bridge the gap between impressionists and cubism, which employed varying perspective and varying angles to depict subjects. As such, this still life is an example of the way in which Cezanne tried to deal with the complexities of visual perception."
Large Bathers,Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,genre painting,"The Bathers is the largest in a series of nude bather paintings by Cezanne, and is often referred to as the “Large Bathers” or “Big Bathers” to distinguish it from the other bather scenes painted by Cezanne. It is also considered one of the masterpieces of modern art, as well as Cezanne’s finest painting. It was purchased for $100,000 for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which was criticized for the expenditure, due to the fact that at the time ten percent of Philadelphia’s population was without bathtubs. The nude figures in the painting have been compared to Picasso’s later work Les Desmoiselles d’Avignon, suggesting the influence that Cezanne had on the painters of the period."
Chateau Noir,Cezanne Paul,Post-Impressionism,landscape,"On a hillside near the Bibémus quarry stood an old country house known as the Château Noir (whose name—the “black manor”—may relate to a previous exterior color). Cézanne began to paint in the area around 1900, finding numerous motifs in the dense woods on the grounds of the estate, for example: Trees and Rocks in the Park of the Château Noir, c. 1904. The house, in its decrepit isolation, inspired some of the artist’s most foreboding images. The eerie structure seen in Château Noir, 1900–1904, seemingly in ruins, is half-hidden behind pines that, like the rocks of Bibémus, almost obstruct the sky. Cézanne’s saturated palette—dark greens, blues and ochers—makes the scene all the more powerful. The somber, enclosed spaces of the paintings of the Château Noir and the Bibémus quarry count among his most emotionally profound pictures and are indicative of a decided melancholy that pervades Cézanne’s work in his last decade. By this time, suffering from diabetes, the artist had become obsessed with the reality of his own mortality."
Large Bathers,Cezanne Paul,Cubism,genre painting,"In his final years, Paul Cézanne painted three large canvases of female nudes in a natural landscape. The largest and the last of these is Large Bathers (1900-1906) at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a monumental painting that presents a harmonious scene of calm and serenity. It represents the culmination of the artist’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/all-works#!#filterName:Series_bathers,resultType:masonry]lifelong exploration[/url] of the traditional theme of nudes in nature. The unfinished state of the painting is also important, as it creates a sense of spatial openness in the composition.

In conceiving [i]Large Bathers[/i] Cézanne drew upon historical precedents in art and his imagination rather than natural observation. He also relied on photographic sources, partly because these did not present him the same challenges as live models: photographs never grew tired or restless, and many scholars have noted that throughout his life Cézanne struggled in the presence of women and had a fear of female sexuality. He owned the book [i]Le Nu au Louvre[/i] (The Nude in the Louvre) by Armand Silvestre, that contained photographs of nudes from Hellenistic to modern times. These were an important source for the painter, who was especially interested in the photographs of sculpture. He also saw many of these works and had sketched them during his visits to the Louvre. In [i]Large Bathers[/i], for instance, the pose of the second figure was likely modeled after several sculptures: the crouched pose is reminiscent of the antique sculpture [i]Vénus de Vienne[/i] and the extended arm could have been modeled after James Pradier’s [i]La Toilette d'Atalante[/i] (1850).

Another characteristic of Cézanne’s canvases of female bathers is the triangular composition. This is evident in the composition of [i]Large Bathers[/i], which consists of two triangular groups of bathers. The groups are surrounded by trees and foliage, that create a pyramidal composition. Cézanne used a pyramidal composition in multiple figure-groups he painted in the late 1870s and 1880s: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/bathers-in-front-of-a-tend][i]Bathers Outside a Tent[/i][/url] (c. 1883-1885) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/five-bathers-1887][i]Five Bathers[/i][/url] (1885-1887). The triangular composition was not unique to Cézanne, it was used by other 19th century French painters, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir]Pierre Renoir[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/the-large-bathers-1887][i]The Large Bathers[/i][/url] (1884-1887).

At the same time, [i]Large Bathers[/i] does not conform to the standard conventions of representing nudes in a landscape. Cézanne’s nude depictions lack the sensuality and eroticism typical of the theme. The painting demonstrates Cézanne’s modern treatment of a traditional theme, particularly his treatment of the human figure: he paints the nude female bodies in the same way he paints the landscape. Cézanne’s bathers are coarse and inelegant, their limbs are inexplicably melded into one another. Scholars have interpreted this in different ways: some emphasized how [i]Large Bathers[/i] represent a new mode of painting, that highlights the purity of form and color rather than anatomical accuracy. Others argue that the de-eroticized nudes reflect Cézanne’s anxieties about women. [i]Large Bathers[/i] holds a significant place in art history, in its innovation and originality it influenced a future generation of artists. It was an important precedent for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-girls-of-avignon-1907][i]Les Demoiselles d'Avignon[/i][/url] (1907) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Henri Matisse[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse/bathers-by-a-river-1916][i]Bathers by a River[/i][/url] (1909-1916)."
The Child in Blue,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,portrait,Very early painting which demonstrates the style he was to use for the next 10 years. A portrait of his brother Rene - Edgar spent his early years portraying himself and his family.
Portrait of René de Gas,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,portrait,"A very early work by Degas, who would go on to become a famous portraitist."
The Bellelli Family,Degas Edgar,Realism,portrait,"Degas’ early masterpiece, The Bellelli Family depicts his aunt, her husband and their two little girls. It is believed that the artist drew each of the figures individually, later combining them in this unique portrayal of their family dynamic. The woman, Degas’ aunt Laura, wears a black dress in mourning for her recently deceased father, whose portrait hangs on the wall behind her. It is likely that this portrait hung at the Paris Salon of 1867, but it was badly hung and as a result was largely ignored by the critics. As a result, Degas kept it in his personal collection, where it remained until he left it to his dealer in 1913. In 1918, after his death, it was revealed an exhibition of the artist’s estate, and was immediately bought for 400,000 by the Luxembourg Museum."
Interior (The Rape),Degas Edgar,Impressionism,interior,"Also known as The Rape, this painting has posed a conundrum for art historians since its creation. During the time it was painted, Degas was known for historical paintings or those with a literary influence, but no such influence or historical story can be related Interior. The most wide agreement is that the painting refers to a scene in the novel Therese Raquin, by Emile Zola, published in 1867. It is referred to as one of the most dramatic and theatrical of all of Degas’ compositions, as the items in the room are placed almost as props and the depiction of the characters had a stage-like, theatrical quality."
A Cotton Office in New Orleans,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,genre painting,"In 1872, Degas traveled with his brother Rene to New Orleans, Louisiana, to visit their uncle, Michel Musson. After his departure in 1873 back to France was delayed, he decided to paint to pass the time, and intended this painting to be sold to a British textile merchant. But, a worldwide decline in cotton prices made it impossible to make the sale, and he instead exhibited the work in the Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1876. In 1878 it was purchased by the Museum of Fine Arts, making it the first sale of one of Degas’ works to a museum."
Woman Ironing (Silhouette),Degas Edgar,Impressionism,genre painting,"Much as Degas was fascinated by the movements of dancers, he was also intrigued by the repetitive, specialized gestures made by laundresses as they worked. This painting, the first of three versions of the composition, is distinguished by its dramatic [i]chiaroscuro[/i], with the woman silhouetted against a luminous white backdrop. Purchased by the singer and collector Jean-Baptiste Faure, the canvas was returned so that Degas could rework it. The artist, however, kept the picture and lent it to the 1876 Impressionist exhibition, receiving praise for his ""rapidly done silhouettes of laundresses."""
The Ballet Class,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,genre painting,"Degas regularly went to the Paris opera house, not only as a member of the audience, but as a visitor backstage and in the dance studio, where he introduced by a friend who played in the orchestra. At that time, the opera was still housed in the rue Le Peletier and had not yet moved to the building designed by Garnier which was soon to replace it. From the 1870s until his death, Degas's favourite subjects were ballerinas at work, in rehearsal or at rest, and he tirelessly explored the theme with many variations in posture and gesture.
More than the stage performance and the limelight, it was the training and rehearsals that interested him. Here the class is coming to an end – the pupils are exhausted, they are stretching, twisting to scratch their backs, adjusting their hair or clothes, an earring, or a ribbon, paying little heed to the inflexible teacher, a portrait of Jules Perrot, a real-life ballet master.

Degas closely observed the most spontaneous, natural, ordinary gestures, the pauses when concentration is relaxed and the body slumps after the exhausting effort of practising and the implacable rigour of the class.

The slightly raised viewpoint looking diagonally across the studio accentuates the vanishing perspective of floor boards. Paul Valéry wrote: ""Degas is one of the very few painters who gave the ground its true importance. He has some admirable floors"". This is all the more appropriate for dancers in that the parquet, which was moistened to prevent slipping, is their main work tool. And the ballet master beats time on the floor with his baton."
The Rehearsal of the Ballet on Stage,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,genre painting,"There are three similar versions of this scene, and their precise relationship has bedeviled scholars for decades. The largest, painted in grisaille (Musée d’Orsay, Paris), appeared in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The two others, tentatively dated the same year, are in the Metropolitan’s collection. This painting probably preceded the version in pastel (29.100.39), which is more freely handled. The importance that Degas attached to the composition is evident in the preparatory drawings that he made for almost every figure, from the dancer scratching her back in the foreground to the woman yawning next to the stage flat."
Place de la Concorde,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,portrait,"This painting depicts the Viscount Ludovic-Napoleon Lepic and his two daughters, strolling through the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. For four decades after World War II, this painting was considered lost. It was found when it was put on display at the Hermitage Museum in Russia, where it still remains. It was later discovered that the Russians had seized the painting from the collections of Otto Gerstenberg during the Soviet occupation of Germany following World War II. The composition, with a large amount of negative space, is thought by art historians to be based off of a photograph, which was an interest of Degas’ in his later life."
The Absinthe Drinker,Degas Edgar,Impressionism,genre painting,"The two figures in this painting are Ellen Andree, a noted French Actress, and Marcellin Desboutin, an artist and noted bohemian personality, sitting at the Café de la Nouvelle-Athenes, in Paris, France. In front of the woman sits a glass of the greenish colored liquid, Absinthe. It was first exhibited in 1872, where it was criticized as ugly and disgusting, and a later exhibition in 1892 it was removed from the show. It was shown a year later inn England, where it sparked controversy. The woman in the painting was derided as a whore and the entire image was seen as a blow to morality and the degradation of society due to absinthe."

Camille Monet and Her Son Jean in the Garden at Argenteuil,Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,portrait,"During the summer of 1874, when Monet, Manet and Renoir worked in close proximity to each other, Monet’s first wife Camille most often posed for Manet and Renoir rather than her husband. Two paintings, one by Manet and one by Renoir, done simultaneously on a summer afternoon, capture a moment of peaceful calm in the Monet's garden. In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: ""Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor [url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436965]painting[/url] of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'"" However later, as a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that ""Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau"". While many Impressionist painters focused on landscapes, Renoir painted people in intimate and candid moments. Renoir’s works are also notable for their use of vibrant light and color. His style emphasized freely brushed touches of color, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings."
Dance at Moulin de la Galette,Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,genre painting,"Dance at Moulin de la Galette  is one of Impressionism’s most highly revered masterpieces. The scene is of a Sunday afternoon at Moulin de la Galette, where Parisians would typically dress up and spend all day dancing, drinking, and eating galettes, or flat cakes. The painting was in the collection of Gustave Caillebotte, but it was claimed by the French government upon his death due to the non payment of death duties. It was later transferred from the Luxembourg Museum, to the Louvre, and then later to the Musee d’Orsay. Its sale price at auction in 2009 was the fifth highest price ever paid for a painting at auction."
Pink and Blue,Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,portrait,"Other wise titled as Alice and Elisabeth Cahen d’Anvers, this painting, which depicts the two daughters of the Jewish banker Louis Raphael Cahen d’Anvers, is considered one of the most popular in the Sao Paolo Museum of Art, where it resides. This particular painting was one of many that the artist produced for the Cahen d’Anvers family, and depicted the girls when they were five and six years old. The original commission was to paint each of the girls separately, but after the eldest daughter was painted by herself, the decision was made to paint the two younger girls together. Elisabeth, the eldest in the painting, had a tragic destiny. Although her sister lived until the ripe age of 89, she was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp due to her Jewish descent, and died at the age of 69 on the way to the concentration camp."
The Luncheon of the Boating Party,Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,genre painting,"Renoir sold this painting to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who supported the impressionists, after its completion. The painting, arguably one of Renoir’s most famous works, contains many of Renoir’s close friends, including his future wife, relaxing at the Maison Fournaise along the Seine River. Renoir often included his friends and acquaintances in his paintings, and this one is no different. At the bottom left of the composition, a woman holding a dog (monkey pincher), is seamstress Aline Charigot, whom later became Renoir’s wife. The painting also includes other close friends, actors, the proprietors of the establishment, and prominent social figures of his day. As such, it can be seen as a snapshot of the social times, as well as a depiction of a relaxing day on the river."
The Blonde Bather (Blonde Bather II),Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,nude painting (nu),"The painting dates back to a phase following the famous impressionist season of the 1870s. A [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/blonde-bather-1881]first version[/url] of the work dates back to 1881 (preserved at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown) which differs in size and chromatic declination of the background. The painting was commissioned to Renoir by the dealer Durand-Ruel, who represented him at the time and who had been favorably impressed by that first draft. The model is Aline Charigot, the artist's partner and then wife, who poses for him on several occasions, while the background alludes, according to Renoir himself, to the bay of Naples. The canvas marks an important change in the painter's work, which began with a trip to Italy and the encounter with ancient art and the works of Raphael. This experience led him to develop drawings with more defined contours and particularly sculptural forms which in the painting are associated with the still impressionistic rendering of the surrounding natural space.

(Description taken and translated from: [url href=https://www.pinacoteca-agnelli.it/collezione/la-baigneuse-blonde/]https://www.pinacoteca-agnelli.it/collezione/la-baigneuse-blonde/[/url])"
By the Seashore,Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,portrait,"After his trip to Italy in 1881, Renoir made changes to his painting style. Instead of painting en plein air, and with quick brush strokes, he began to carefully outline his figures, and to emphasize the contours and modeling of the scene. It has been referred to as Renoir’s “Ingres Period,” as he was highly influenced by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, the prominent neo-classical painter. The woman in the painting is Renoir’s girlfriend, Aline Charigot, who became his wife seven years after this painting was completed. It now resides, as it has since 1929, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City"
The Large Bathers,Renoir Pierre-Auguste,Impressionism,nude painting (nu),"Renoir labored over this painting for a period of three years before he was happy with its composition. Along with at least two full-sized figure drawings of the models, Renoir also created many preparatory drawings for each of the figures before eventually putting brush to canvas. Due to the criticism he received for the painting’s  sculptural smoothness and a change in the artist’s perceived style, Renoir, who was exhausted by the effort, claimed that he would never again devote such a long period of time for a single piece of work."
Frieda and Diego Rivera,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),portrait,"It is as if in this painting Kahlo tries on the role of wife to see how it fits. She does not focus on her identity as a painter, but instead adopts a passive and supportive role, holding the hand of her talented and acclaimed husband. It was indeed the case that during the majority of her painting career, Kahlo was viewed only in Rivera's shadow and it was not until later in life that she gained international recognition.

This early double-portrait was painted primarily to mark the celebration of Kahlo's marriage to Rivera. Whilst Rivera holds a palette and paintbrushes, symbolic of his artistic mastery, Kahlo limits her role to his wife by presenting herself slight in frame and without her artistic accouterments. Kahlo furthermore dresses in a costume typical of the Mexican woman, or [i]La Mexicana[/i], wearing a traditional red shawl known as the [i]rebozo[/i] and jade Aztec beads. The positioning of the figures echoes that of traditional marital portraiture where the wife is placed on her husband's left to indicate her lesser moral status as a woman. In a lithograph made the following year called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/frida-and-the-miscarriage-1932][i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i][/url] (1932), the artist does hold her own palette, as though the experience of losing a fetus and not being able to create a baby shifts her determination wholly to the creation of art.

Frieda gave this painting to art collector Albert Bender in gratitude for the USA entry visa he helped to acquire for Diego. Rivera had previously been refused entry into the USA due to his Communist party affiliation. In the title of this printing, Frida uses the German spelling of her name: [i]Frieda[/i]. The banner at the top of the painting proclaims: ""Here you see us, me, Frieda Kahlo, with my beloved husband Diego Rivera. I painted these portraits in the beautiful city of San Francisco California for our friend Mr. Albert Bender, and it was in the month of April of the year 1931"". When the painting was finished, a San Francisco newspaper described the work as being: ""...valuable only because it was painted by the wife of Diego Rivera "".

This painting was shown at the ""Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists"" - the first public showing of Frida's work."
Frida and the Miscarriage,Kahlo Frida ,"Naïve Art (Primitivism), Surrealism",self-portrait,"During the period following her miscarriage, Frida produced a lithograph entitled [i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i]. Only three proofs of the twelve that she originally made are still in existence; Frida herself destroyed all the others. In the left margin, she wrote in English: “These proofs are not good nor bad considering your experience. Work harder and you will get better results"". She portrays herself standing nude with a necklace around her neck and large tears running down her cheeks. There is a fetus in her womb and beside her, connected to her by an umbilical cord, the second fetus of a larger child. Blood runs down her leg from her vagina and seeps into the earth, nourishing it and giving life to plants in the form of a child’s eyes, hands, and genitals. The waxing moon in the sky also weeps as it gazes at Frida, who is holding a heart-shaped palette in her left hand, as though painting constituted a refuge from her lost maternity.“Many things prevented the fulfillment of the desire all consider normal,” said Frida, “and nothing seemed more normal to me than to paint what I had not achieved.” On another occasion, she explained it in this way: “My painting carries within a message of pain. . . Painting completed my life. I lost three children. . . Painting replaced all of that"". [i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i] was her only incursion into lithography. It seems the technique was complicated for her and little suited to her artistic purposes."
Henry Ford Hospital (The Flying Bed),Kahlo Frida ,"Naïve Art (Primitivism), Surrealism",genre painting,"On 4 July 1932, Frida had a miscarriage in Detroit, after being under the supervision of her doctors, who recommended long periods of complete bed rest to bring her pregnancy to term. Her body, however, was unable to resist and she was finally taken to the Henry Ford Hospital, where an abortion was performed to finish the process that had begun at home.
Some days later, in a state of deep depression, Frida asked to be brought the fetus of her child so that she could paint it. She was not granted her wish, having to make do with some illustrations provided by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego[/url] and her doctors, with which she began to create this work, named after the hospital in which she was cared for.

Many of Kahlo's paintings from the early 1930s, especially in size, format, architectural setting, and spatial arrangement relate to religious [i]ex-voto[/i] paintings of which she and Rivera possessed a large collection ranging in the date over several centuries. [i]Ex-votos[/i] are made as a gesture of gratitude for salvation, a granted prayer or disaster averted and left in churches or at shrines. [i]Ex-votos[/i] are generally painted on small-scale metal panels and depict the incident along with the Virgin or saint to whom they are offered. [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i] (1932) is a good example where the artist uses the [i]ex-voto[/i] format but subverts it by placing herself center stage, rather than recording the miraculous deeds of saints. Kahlo paints her own story, as though she becomes saintly and the work is made not as thanks to the lord but in defiance, questioning why he brings her pain. [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i] is the first painting for which Frida used a metal sheet as a support, in the tradition of Mexican ex-votos, or votive tablets. She continued to use metal in her later works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/my-birth-1932][i]My Birth[/i][/url] (1932), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-along-the-boarder-line-between-mexico-and-the-united-states-1932][i]Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and The United States[/i] [/url] (1932), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-necklace-1933][i]Self-Portrait with Necklace[/i][/url] (1933), etc.

In [i]Henry Ford Hospital[/i], Kahlo lies on a bed, bleeding after a miscarriage. From the exposed naked body six vein-like ribbons flow outwards, attached to symbols. One of these six objects is a fetus, suggesting that the ribbons could be a metaphor for umbilical cords. The other five objects that surround Frida are things that she remembers or things that she had seen in the hospital. For example, the snail makes reference to the time it took for the miscarriage to be over, whilst the flower was an actual physical object given to her by Diego. The artist demonstrates her need to be attached to all that surrounds her: to the mundane and metaphorical as much as the physical and actual. Perhaps it is through this reaching out of connectivity that the artist tries to be 'maternal', even though she is not able to have her own child. Tears pour from Frida’s eyes. There is a view of the Ford Motor Company in the industrial city of Detroit on the horizon, where Rivera was painting some murals. 

Frida Kahlo produced a number of portraits with the subjects in bed. This includes [i]My Birth[/i] (1932), where she captures her own birth, complete with soiled sheets that tell the story of what has just happened. Beyond that, she used a bed in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/a-few-small-nips-passionately-in-love-1935][i]A Few Small Nips[/i][/url] (1935), based on newspaper accounts of a brutal murder, related to her feelings of being ‘murdered by life’. It was timed just as Frida became aware of her husband's misdemeanors, which left her emotionally broken. Sometime in the previous year, Rivera had embarked upon an affair with her younger sister Cristina, which wounded Kahlo deeply. Rivera later commented that the paintings Kahlo made in 1932 were ‘much better than those she executed before losing her baby,’ describing her as: ‘The only artist in the history of art who tore open her chest and heart to reveal the biological truth of her feelings.’ Her dramatic scenes of pain and anguish have successfully built a strong following of support, partly due to her consistent role as the woman who was talented but also taken advantage of. Modern society is growing in support for female rights and this has helped to make Frida Kahlo a true icon, almost a martyr for the mistreated gender."
My Birth,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),genre painting,"This is a haunting painting in which both the birth giver and the birthed child seem dead. The head of the woman giving birth is shrouded in white cloth while the baby emerging from the womb appears lifeless. At the time that Kahlo painted this work, her mother had just died so it seems reasonable to assume that the shrouded funerary figure is her mother while the baby is Kahlo herself (the title supports this reading). However, Kahlo had also just lost her own child and has said that she is the covered mother figure. The Virgin of Sorrows, who hangs above the bed suggests that this is an image that overflows with maternal pain and suffering. Also though, and revealingly, Kahlo wrote in her diary, next to several small drawings of herself, 'the one who gave birth to herself ... who wrote the most wonderful poem of her life.' Similar to the lithograph [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/frida-and-the-miscarriage-1932][i]Frida and the Miscarriage[/i][/url] (1932), [i]My Birth[/i] represents Kahlo mourning for the loss of a child, but also finding the strength to make powerful art because of such trauma.

The painting is made in a [i]retablo[/i] (or votive) style (a small traditional Mexican painting derived from Catholic Church art) in which thanks would typically be given to the Madonna beneath the image. Kahlo instead leaves this section blank, as though she finds herself unable to give thanks either for her own birth or for the fact that she is now unable to give birth. The painting seems to bring the message that it is important to acknowledge that birth and death live very closely together. Many believe that [i]My Birth[/i] was heavily inspired by an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/aztec-art/tlazolteotl-birthing-figure]Aztec-style sculpture of Tlazolteotl[/url], the Goddess of fertility and midwives.

Popstar Madonna collected this painting. In an interview with [i]Vanity Fair[/i], Madonna said she used this painting to tell who is her friend and who is not. “If somebody doesn’t like this painting”, Madonna said, “then I know they can’t be my friend”."
My Dress Hangs There,Kahlo Frida ,"Naïve Art (Primitivism), Surrealism",symbolic painting,"This painting represents a portrait of American capitalism and its contradictions as Frida saw them in 1933. Traveling with her husband, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego Rivera[/url], who painted commissioned murals in San Francisco, Detroit, and New York, she found herself abandoned in a culture she despised. After more than three years spent in the United States, Frida desperately wanted to go back to Mexico. But Rivera, at the time a prominent Mexican painter, wanted to stay in the United States and refused to go back. In the midst of this conflict, she painted [i]My Dress Hangs There[/i].

The painting expresses her dissatisfaction with the United States, its societal collapse, and its utter disrespect for fundamental human values. The painting is filled with the symbols of modern industrial society which treats people like machines. In contrast to this painting, Diego Rivera was working on a mural in the Rockefeller Center with which he was expressing his approval of the industrial progress in the United States.

[i]My Dress Hangs There[/i], set amongst the towers of New York, makes a mockery out of the modern American obsession with sport by placing a trophy and a toilet on top of classical columns, indicating the hypocrisy of the society, stating that the achievements are valued above all else that is human. Through numerous symbols that can be found on this painting, like wrapping a dollar sign around the cross or the garbage bin, Frida highlights the dichotomy of life in New York. She presents the decay, alienation, and destroyed human values that can be seen behind the illusion of wealth.

Surrounded by all this, stands Kahlo’s Tehuana dress, intact and pure. The Tehuana dress comes from the traditional costume of Zapotec women, and it became one of the main features connected not only to Kahlo's work, but to her personal fashion as well. Because Zapotec women live in a matriarchal society, their dress came to be a symbol of a female power, and thus appealed to Kahlo. She molded and fashioned the garment over time to reflect her own narrative of identity, heritage, and personal history. At the time when Mexico was trying to rediscover its indigenous heritage and promote traditional Mexican values, Kahlo, by adopting this costume into her everyday live, and through paintings such as these, developed her own brand of Mexicanidad, her own individual Mexican identity.

The absence of the central figure makes this painting atypical for Frida’s style. This painting is missing the focal point of her work, it’s missing Frida herself. She only paints her dress hanging empty and alone with the chaos of the modern city around it. With the lack of her own body in the painting, she is expressing her inner conflict. Her body might be in New York, but her soul is longing for the vibrancy of Mexico City."
"My Grandparents, My Parents, and I (Family Tree)",Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),portrait,"This dream-like family tree was painted on zinc rather than canvas, a choice that further highlights the artist's fascination with and collection of 18th-century and 19th-century Mexican [i]retablos[/i] (devotional folk paintings using iconography derived from traditional Catholic church art). Kahlo completed this work to accentuate both her European Jewish heritage and her Mexican background. Her paternal side, German Jewish, occupies the right side of the composition symbolized by the sea (acknowledging her father's voyage to get to Mexico), while her maternal side of Mexican descent is represented on the left by a map faintly outlining the topography of Mexico.

While Kahlo's paintings are assertively autobiographical, she often used them to communicate transgressive or political messages: this painting was completed shortly after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/adolf-hitler]Adolf Hitler[/url] passed the Nuremberg laws banning interracial marriage. Here, Kahlo simultaneously affirms her mixed heritage to confront Nazi ideology, using a format - the genealogical chart - employed by the Nazi party to determine racial purity. Beyond politics, the red ribbon used to link the family members echoes the umbilical cord that connects baby Kahlo to her mother - a motif that recurs throughout Kahlo's oeuvre."
Fulang-Chang and I,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),self-portrait,"This painting debuted at Kahlo's exhibition in Julien Levy's New York gallery in 1938, and was one of the works that most fascinated André Breton, the founder of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The canvas in the New York show is a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] of the artist and her spider monkey, Fulang-Chang, a symbol employed as a surrogate for the children that she and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url] could not have. The arrangement of figures in the portrait signals the artist's interest in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] paintings of the Madonna and Child. After the New York exhibition, a second frame containing a mirror was added. The later inclusion of the mirror is a gesture inviting the viewer into the work: it was through looking at herself intensely in a mirror in her months spent at home after her bus accident that Kahlo first began painting portraits and delving deeper into her [i]psyche[/i]. The inclusion of the mirror, considered from this perspective, is a remarkably intimate vision into both the artist's aesthetic process and into her personal introspection.

In many of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Kahlo's self-portraits[/url], she is accompanied by monkeys, dogs, and parrots, all of which she kept as pets. Since the Middle Ages, small spider monkeys, like those kept by Kahlo, have been said to symbolize the devil, heresy, and paganism, finally coming to represent the fall of man, vice, and the embodiment of lust. These monkeys were depicted in the past as a cautionary symbol against the dangers of excessive love and the base instincts of man. Kahlo again depicts herself with her monkey in both [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-a-monkey-1938]1938[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-monkey-1940]1940[/url]. In a later version in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frida-kahlo/self-portrait-with-small-monkey-1945]1945[/url], Kahlo paints her monkey and also her dog, [i]Xolotl[/i]. This little dog that often accompanies the artist, is named after a mythological Aztec god, known to represent lightning and death, and also to be the twin of [i]Quetzalcoatl[/i], both of who had visited the underworld. All of these pictures, including [i]Fulang-Chang and I[/i] include 'umbilical' ribbons that wrap between Kahlo's and the animal's necks. Kahlo is the Madonna and her pets become the holy (yet darkly symbolic) infant for which she longs."
What the Water Gave Me,Kahlo Frida ,"Naïve Art (Primitivism), Surrealism","symbolic painting, self-portrait","In this painting, most of Kahlo's body is obscured from view. We are unusually confronted with the foot and plug end of the bath, and with focus placed on the artist's feet. Furthermore, Kahlo adopts a birds-eye view and looks down on the water from above. Within the water, Kahlo paints an alternative [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url], one in which the more traditional facial portrait has been replaced by an array of symbols and recurring motifs. The artist includes portraits of her parents, a traditional Tehuana dress, a perforated shell, a dead hummingbird, two female lovers, a skeleton, a crumbling skyscraper, a ship set sail, and a woman drowning. This painting was featured in Breton's 1938 book on [i]Surrealism and Painting[/i] and Hayden Herrera, in her biography of Kahlo, mentions that the artist herself considered this work to have a special importance. Recalling the tapestry style painting of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance]Northern Renaissance[/url] masters, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder]Pieter Bruegel the Elder[/url], the figures and objects floating in the water of Kahlo's painting create an at once fantastic and real landscape of memory.

Kahlo discussed [i]What the Water Gave Me[/i] with the Manhattan gallery owner Julien Levy, and suggested that it was a sad piece that mourned the loss of her childhood. Perhaps the strangled figure at the center is representative of the inner emotional torments experienced by Kahlo herself. It is clear from the conversation that the artist had with Levy, that Kahlo was aware of the philosophical implications of her work. In an interview with Herrera, Levy recalls, in 'a long philosophical discourse, Kahlo talked about the perspective of herself that is shown in this painting'. He further relays that 'her idea was about the image of yourself that you have because you do not see your head. The head is something that is looking but is not seen. It is what one carries around to look at life with.' The artist's head in [i]What the Water Gave Me[/i] is thus appropriately replaced by the interior thoughts that occupy her mind. As well as inclusion of death by strangulation in the center of the water, there is also a labia-like flower and a cluster of pubic hair painted between Kahlo's legs. The work is quite sexual while also showing a preoccupation with destruction and death. The motif of the bathtub in art is one that has been popular since [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david]Jacques-Louis David[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-death-of-marat-1793][i]The Death of Marat[/i][/url] (1793), and was later taken up many different personalities such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman]Francesca Woodman[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tracey-emin]Tracey Emin[/url]."
The Two Fridas,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),self-portrait,"Frida Kahlo's work placed Mexican art on the international stage. Her style was figurative and self-taught, with elements of the fantastical and an emphasis on her own individual, biographical perspective. Her self-referential art, now a media phenomenon, originated in the development of her portrait painting which, from early on, became her most effective device for expressing a certain unease about exploring her own personality.

In 1938, André Breton labeled Kahlo's work as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/surrealism]surrealist[/url], leading to [i]The Two Fridas[/i] being exhibited at the [i]International Exhibition of Surrealism[/i], organized by the Gallery of Mexican Art in 1940. This double [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] is one of Kahlo's most recognized compositions and is symbolic of the artist's emotional pain experienced during her divorce from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url]. On the left, the artist is shown in modern European attire, wearing the costume from her marriage to Rivera. Throughout their marriage, given Rivera's strong nationalism, Kahlo became increasingly interested in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/indigenism]Indigenism[/url] and began to explore traditional Mexican costume, which she wears in the portrait on the right. It is the Mexican Kahlo that holds a locket with an image of Rivera. The stormy sky in the background, and the artist's bleeding heart - a fundamental symbol of Catholicism and also symbolic of Aztec ritual sacrifice - accentuate Kahlo's personal tribulation and physical pain.

Symbolic elements frequently possess multiple layers of meaning in Kahlo's pictures; the recurrent theme of blood represents both metaphysical and physical suffering, gesturing also to the artist's ambivalent attitude toward accepted notions of womanhood and fertility. Although both women have their hearts exposed, the woman in the white European outfit also seems to have had her heart dissected and the artery that runs from this heart is cut and bleeding. The artery that runs from the heart of her Tehuana-costumed self remains intact because it is connected to the miniature photograph of Diego as a child. Whereas Kahlo's heart in the Mexican dress remains sustained, the European Kahlo, disconnected from her beloved Diego, bleeds profusely onto her dress. As well as being one of the artist's most famous works, this is also her largest canvas."
Self Portrait with Cropped Hair,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),self-portrait,"This self-portrait shows Kahlo as an androgynous figure. Scholars have seen this gesture as a confrontational response to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Rivera[/url]'s demand for a divorce, revealing the artist's injured sense of female pride and her self-punishment for the failures of her marriage. Her masculine attire also reminds the viewer of early family photographs in which Kahlo chose to wear a suit. The cropped hair also presents a nuanced expression of the artist's identity. She holds one cut braid in her left hand while many strands of hair lie scattered on the floor. The act of cutting a braid symbolizes a rejection of girlhood and innocence, but equally can be seen as the severance of a connective cord (maybe umbilical) that binds two people or two ways of life. Either way, braids were a central element in Kahlo's identity as the traditional [i]La Mexicana[/i], and in the act of cutting off her braids, she rejects some aspect of her former identity.

The hair strewn about the floor echoes an earlier self-portrait painted as the Mexican folkloric figure [i]La Llorana,[/i] here ridding herself of these female attributes. Kahlo clutches a pair of scissors, as the discarded strands of hair become animated around her feet; the tresses appear to have a life of their own as they curl across the floor and around the legs of her chair. Above her sorrowful scene, Kahlo inscribed the lyrics and music of a song that declares cruelly, ""Look, if I loved you it was for your hair, now that you are hairless, I don't love you anymore,"" confirming Kahlo's own denunciation and rejection of her female roles.

In likely homage to Kahlo's painting, Finnish photographer [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus]Elina Brotherus[/url] photographed [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus/wedding-portraits-1997][i]Wedding Portraits[/i][/url] in 1997. On the occasion of her marriage, Brotherus cuts her hair, the remains of which her new husband holds in his hands. The act of cutting one's hair symbolic of a moment of change happens in the work of other female artists too, including that of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman]Francesca Woodman[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rebecca-horn]Rebecca Horn[/url]."
The Broken Column,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),self-portrait,"Kahlo was 18 years old when she was involved in a horrific traffic accident, in which an iron rod pierced her abdomen, right foot was crushed, and two vertebrae were fractured, as well as a number of other bones, including eleven fractures in her right leg. As she recovered in a full body cast, her mother brought her a small lap easel, and, with a mirror over her bed, began painting self-portraits. This self-portrait embodies many elements that were in Kahlo’s artwork, including the themes of isolation, a broken body, and intense suffering and pain. This painting also embodies another one of Kahlo’s themes, that of two bodies, one of which she is a complete and full bodied woman, and another, reflecting broken insides."
The Wounded Deer,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),self-portrait,"Later in her life, Kahlo was interested in ancient Eastern religions and mysticism, and The Little Deer is an assimilation of her Mexican and European heritage with these ancient beliefs. The image is of Kahlo’s head placed on top of a stag, which is pierced with arrows. The arrows no doubt refer to her own pain and suffering due to her injuries, as well as her injurious marriage to Diego Rivera. At the bottom of the painting, Kahlo has written “carma,” alluding to these ancient mystic beliefs. She also combines the eastern belief system with Aztec. An ancient Aztec symbol, the deer symbolized the right foot, and in this she was alluding to her injured right side, the foot of which had been crushed in a bus accident, and right leg being fractured in eleven different places. One year before her death, her right leg was amputated up to her right knee, due to complications from gangrene."
Diego and I,Kahlo Frida ,Naïve Art (Primitivism),self-portrait,"Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo’s marriage was tumultuous at best. Frida created this painting during a particularly low point in their marriage. Rivera was having an affair with the movie star Maria Felix, and he was rumored to ask her to marry hum. Although both of them had extramarital affairs, this one was particularly painful, as illustrated by this painting. Many times, Kahlo was able to laugh at Rivera’s indiscretions, but this painting shows real pain and suffering. She once referred to two accidents in her life; one of them being the streetcar accident, the other being Diego Rivera."
A Glimpse of Notre-Dame in the Late Afternoon,Matisse Henri,Fauvism,cityscape,"The dark colors and somber mood in this painting exhibit what had been come to be known as Matisse’s dark period, a time when he was going through personal difficulties. One personal difficulty was that Matisse was not able to find many buyers for his works, which made it hard to provide for his family. His wife had to open a dress shop in order to help provide for the family. These hardships were compounded when Matisse and his wife, Amelie, were found to be scapegoats for a conspiracy involving Amelie’s mother, a housekeeper for the Humbert family. Amelie was forced to close her shop, and Matisse was left to provide for his entire family again. This can partially explain Matisse’s shift during this time to more saleable canvases."
Woman with a Hat,Matisse Henri,Fauvism,portrait,"Matisse attacked conventional portraiture with this image of his wife. Amelie's pose and dress are typical for the day, but Matisse roughly applied brilliant color across her face, hat, dress, and even the background. This shocked his contemporaries when he sent the picture to the 1905 Salon d'Automne. Leo Stein called it, ""the nastiest smear of paint I had ever seen,"" yet he and Gertrude bought it for the importance they knew it would have to modern painting."
The Joy of Life,Matisse Henri,Fauvism,genre painting,"During his Fauve years Matisse often painted landscapes in the south of France during the summer and worked up ideas developed there into larger compositions upon his return to Paris. Joy of Live, the second of his important imaginary compositions, is typical of these. He used a landscape he had painted in Collioure to provide the setting for the idyll, but it is also influenced by ideas drawn from Watteau, Poussin, Japanese woodcuts, Persian miniatures, and 19th century Orientalist images of harems. The scene is made up of independent motifs arranged to form a complete composition. The massive painting and its shocking colors received mixed reviews at the Salon des Indépendants. Critics noted its new style -- broad fields of color and linear figures, a clear rejection of Paul Signac's celebrated Pointillism."
The Young Sailor II,Matisse Henri,Expressionism,portrait,"Matisse painted two versions of this painting, this one having sharper lines and brighter colors than the first version. Although the title is “The Young Sailor,” the model for the painting was actually an 18 year old fisherman named Germain Augustin Barthelemy Montarges. The piece was painted in at Matisse’s home in Coillioure, during what was to be known as his fauvre summer, during which he had been painting self-portraits when he convinced the young fisherman to pose for him. The painting now hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it is one of the most prized of the painting in the museum."
The Blue Nude (Souvenir of Biskra),Matisse Henri,Fauvism,nude painting (nu),"Matisse was working on a sculpture, Reclining Nude I, when he accidentally damaged the piece. Before repairing it, he painted it in blue against a background of palm fronds. The nude is hard and angular, both a tribute to Cézanne and to the sculpture Matisse saw in Algeria. She is also a deliberate response to nudes seen in the Paris Salon - ugly and hard rather than soft and pretty. This was the last Matisse painting bought by Leo and Gertrude Stein."
Dance (II),Matisse Henri,"Expressionism, Fauvism",genre painting,"There are two versions of The Dance, the first, painted in March of 1909, is the study for the second one, completed in 1910. The large work, painted along the lines of William Blake’s painting “Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing,” was painted along with its companion piece, Music, which depicts nudes playing music in a similar setting. The pieces were specially created for Russian businessman and art collector Sergei Shchukin, who was a long-time associate of Matisse’s. This painting is often recognized as a key point in the development of Matisse’s artwork, as well as in the development of modern painting. It is also often associated with “Dance of the Young Girls,” in The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky."
Music,Matisse Henri,"Expressionism, Fauvism",genre painting,"""Music"" forms a pair to ""The Dance"", also painted in 1910. After the collector Sergey Shchukin commissioned ""The Dance"", he wrote to Matisse asking for another panel on the subject of music. It is only when seen together that they acquire their full resonance.

Matisse worked on the huge canvas for ""Music"" without preparatory sketches and rethought the composition numerous times. The canvas thus bears the traces of numerous alterations, and we can almost trace all the steps in the artist's difficult search for the desired effect. Once complete, the central idea of the Shchukin ensemble was man's achievement of a state of completeness through passionate immersion in creativity.

""Music"" is built up of the same three elements as ""The Dance"": the same expressive harmony of green, red and blue; the five simplified figures of musicians and singers accord with the five dancers; as in ""The Dance"", Man is one with Earth and Heaven. He has mounted the hill, torn himself away from everyday routine and become an image-symbol, existing outside of time and space. But ""Music"" amazes us with its concentrated calm, the absolute immobility of the isolated figures, the total concentration on the playing of musical instruments and singing. The open mouths seem to resonate and force us to physically experience the human voices pouring from within. Whilst the figures, who seem almost like musical notation on a page, are totally enclosed within themselves, the music unites them in a single whole, the violin-playing conductor acting as the central figure in the composition."
Conversation,Matisse Henri,Expressionism,genre painting,"This painting portrays Matisse and his wife, facing each other in a blue room, and was created specifically for the collection of Russian art collector Sergei Shchukin, where it hung in his house until it was sized during the Russian Revolution of 1917, and later donated to the public. In the painting, Matisse wears the fashionable pajamas, which were introduced from India, where they were the traditional garb of tea-planters. Matisse found them so comfortable that he would paint in them, making them his working clothes. It now hangs in the collection of the Hermitage, in Saint Petersburg, Russia."
Jeannette I,Matisse Henri,Expressionism,sculpture,"In the process of creating five busts of Jeanne Vaderin between 1910 and 1913, Matisse radically reconfigured traditional representation of the human face. Jeannette I and II were created directly from the model, which is evident in their characteristic, hawklike profiles. These two works then served as templates for Jeannette III, IV, and V. As he progressed with the series, Matisse dramatically abstracted his subject, organizing the head into increasingly simplified chunks. In 1908 he explained that his goal in portraiture was not to achieve visual precision but rather to reveal the ""essential qualities"" of his sitters—qualities, he felt, that physical imitation could not capture."
Bathers by a River,Matisse Henri,Cubism,genre painting,"Matisse regarded this picture as one of the most important in his career, and it is certainly one of his most puzzling. He worked on it at intervals over eight years, and it passed through a variety of transformations. The painting evolved out of a commission from Matisse's Russian patron, Sergei Shchuckin, for two decorative panels on the subjects of dance and music, and, initially, the scheme for the picture resembled the idyllic scenes he had previously depicted in paintings such as Joy of Life (1905-06). However, his transformations gradually turned it into more of a confrontation with Cubism, and it is for this reason that the picture has been the subject of intense scrutiny. Although Matisse rejected Cubism, he certainly felt challenged by it, and this picture - along with many he painted from 1913 to 1917 - seems to be influenced by the style, since it is very unlike his previous, more decorative work. It is far more concerned with faithful representation of the structure of the human figure, and its position in space."
The Moroccans,Matisse Henri,Cubism,genre painting,"Matisse planned this picture as early as 1913, and it recalls visits made to Morocco around this time. A figure sits on the right with a back to us, fruit lies in the left foreground, and a mosque rises in the background beyond a terrace. Matisse said that he occasionally used black in his pictures in order to simplify the composition, though here it undoubtedly also recalls the stark shadows produced by the strong sunshine in the region. Like Bathers by a River (1917), The Moroccans was significantly influenced by Picasso's Cubism, and some have even compared it to Picasso's Three Musicians (1921). Although it employs the same brilliant color as much of Matisse's work, its use of abstract motifs and rigid diagrammatic composition is unusual, and has attracted considerable speculation. Rather than use the scene as an opportunity for decoration, it is as if Matisse has tried to find the means to chart and map it."
The Windshield,Matisse Henri,Fauvism,landscape,"Matisse painted this canvas in the summer of 1917 while being chauffeured by his son Pierre toward an airport on the outskirts of Paris. Suddenly, Matisse decided to paint the road from inside the car, which proved challenging, as zooming traffic forced the artist to keep the windows shut and constantly rocked the old Renault back and forth. Matisse nonetheless produced a novel view of life in the modern automobile age."
Tea,Matisse Henri,Expressionism,genre painting,"[i]Tea[/i] is the largest painting executed by Henri Matisse in the years just after World War I. It marks a notable departure from the artist's Fauve work, in which he sought to transform his feelings into pure color. This garden scene depicts Matisse's model Antoinette Arnoud, his daughter Marguerite, and his dog Lili relaxing at the artist's residence in the Parisian suburb of Issy-les-Moulineaux. Although Matisse's use of sunlight evokes the Impressionists' attraction to painting directly from nature, he focused more on communicating the cool lushness of the scene through adherence to local color. The masklike face of Marguerite, on the right, reflects the artist's long-standing interest in African art and contrasts sharply with the more conventionally rendered face of Antoinette. In this sense, Tea is a logical extension of Matisse's formative work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse/by-series/five-busts-of-jeanne-vaderin]Heads of Jeannette[/url] (1910-13), in which he progressively abstracted the female visage in a sequence of five bronze sculptures. In 1929 British art critic Roger Fry remarked that he found this painting to be ""one of the most complete expressions of Matisse's highest powers."" [i]Tea[/i] was the last major Matisse painting acquired by Michael and Sarah Stein, brother and sister-in-law of Gertrude Stein and notable collectors in their own right."

The Dance,Matisse Henri,Expressionism,genre painting,"Albert Barnes, a doctor and art lover, commissioned Matisse in 1931 to paint a mural for the main hall of his gallery housing works by Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, and others. Matisse created a maquette for the mural out of cut paper, which he could rearrange as he determined the composition. However, the finished work was too small for the space due to being given incorrect measurements. Rather than add a decorative border, Matisse decided to recompose the entire piece, resulting in a dynamic composition, in which bodies seem to leap across abstracted space of pink and blue fields."
Kathy With a Yellow Dress,Matisse Henri,Expressionism,"figurative, nude painting (nu)",His last painting.
Blue Nude II,Matisse Henri,Abstract Expressionism,nude painting (nu),"Matisse completed a series of four blue nudes in 1952, each in his favorite pose of entwined legs and raised arm. Matisse had been making cut-outs for eleven years, but had not yet seriously attempted to portray the human figure. In preparation for these works, Matisse filled a notebook with studies. He then created a figure that is abstracted and simplified, a symbol for the nude, before incorporating the nude into his large-scale murals."
The Snail,Matisse Henri,"Abstract Art, Color Field Painting",abstract,"The Snail (L'escargot) is a collage by Henri Matisse. The work was created from summer 1952 to early 1953. It is pigmented with gouache on paper, cut and pasted onto a base layer of white paper measuring 9'43⁄4"" × 9' 5"" (287 × 288 cm). The piece is in the Tate Gallery collection in London. It consists of a number of colored shapes arranged in a spiral pattern, as suggested by the title. Matisse first drew the snail, then used the colored paper to interpret it. The composition pairs complementary colors: Matisse gave the work the alternative title La Composition Chromatique (chromatic composition). From the early-to-mid-1940s Matisse was in increasingly poor health, and was suffering from arthritis. Eventually by 1950 he stopped painting in favor of gouaches découpées, paper cutouts. The Snail is a major example of this final body of works. Color field painters and minimalists such as Ellsworth Kelly, Alma Thomas or Kenneth Noland have continued in many ways the reduction to color done by Matisse in later works, among which The Snail can be considered the closest to contemporary abstract art."
129 Die in Jet!,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,illustration,"129 Die in Jet! is a painting created by American Pop artist Andy Warhol in 1962, made with acrylic and pencil on canvas, 100 x 72 inches (254 x 182.9 cm).[1]

Warhol created this work after the Air France Flight 007 accident in which 129 (later 130 after one died of injuries) people aboard were killed with only 2 (initially 3) survivors. The Atlanta Art Association had sponsored a month-long tour of the art treasures of Europe, and 106[2] of the passengers were art patrons heading home to Atlanta on this charter flight. The tour group included many of Atlanta's cultural and civic leaders. Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr. went to Orly to inspect the crash site where so many important Atlantans perished."
Coca-Cola (3),Warhol Andy,Pop Art,advertisement,"Coca-Cola 3 is a painting by Andy Warhol. He completed the painting in 1962 as a wider series on Coca-Cola paintings, which also included Green Coca-Cola Bottles and Coca-Cola (4). The painting and others in the series are considered founding paintings of the pop art movement.

The painting is a 6-foot, black and white painting of a Coca-Cola bottle from the era.

Warhol is best known for his famous Campbells soup cans which was completed around the same time as Coca-Cola(3), between 1961 and 1962.[5] Campbell’s soup cans share the idea of the commercial culture of Warhol’s Coca-Cola series. Warhol first began working with Coca-Cola bottles in the early 1950s when he would use images of Coke bottles from magazines to create collages.[5] Warhol had a unique perspective and interest on coke bottles. Warhol would state that “A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke.”,[5] alluding to the idea of economic and political equality. Some of his most famous works focus on mass-produced items, such as soup cans and coke bottles, products that consistently remained the same quality, no matter how much you paid for it. Warhol was attracted to the idea that no matter who you are, you cannot purchase a better coke or can of soup than the next person. Ultimately, Warhol admired the uniformity of items such as soup cans and coke bottles.[6]

Warhol’s first Stable show featured three known serial works of one hundred soups cans, one hundred dollar bills and one hundred coke bottles.[6] Between 1960 and 1960 Warhol created two versions of Coca-Cola (3). They were very similar to each other, however, one featured a large dark splotch on the top right corner of the canvas.[7] In his career, Warhol created 15 pieces associated to Coca-Cola.[8]"
Green Coca-Cola Bottles,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,advertisement,"Warhol created several notable works in the early 1960s. This began with the famous Campbell's Soup Cans, which was completed between 1961 and early 1962.[2] During this period, Warhol experimented with numerous common items, before creating the Green Coca-Cola Bottles painting in 1962. This period is often referred back to as Warhol's earlier work.[citation needed]

In his early days as an artist, Warhol experimented with the Coca-Cola bottle beginning in the 1950s. The first known artwork of Warhol's was an ink-on-gouache drawing of a Coca-Cola bottle with a pair of legs. In the early 1960s, before the creation of Campbell's Soup Cans, he used to tear Coca-Cola bottle images from magazines to use them in collages.[3]

This inspiration and early use of the Coca-Cola bottle led him to create Green Coca-Cola Bottles in 1962.[3]

Green Coca-Cola Bottles took a mainstream item and converted it into a piece of art. Warhol’s piece utilized a silkscreen technique, which mechanicalized some aspects of the painting but featured individualized “unevenness” across the painting. The painting engenders an optimistic message for the American public, described in Warhol’s own words, “What’s grand about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same thing as the poorest... you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and, just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke.”[4]"
Gold Marilyn Monroe,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,portrait,"Gold Marilyn Monroe is a screenprint painting by Andy Warhol based on a photograph of the actress Marilyn Monroe's face centered on a large (6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) x 4 ft 9 in (1.45 m)) gold-painted canvas.[1][2] Warhol used silkscreen ink on synthetic polymer paint on canvas. It was completed in 1962, the same year as Monroe's death.[3] The image of Monroe is a direct copy of a close-up shot from her 1953 film Niagara.

Gold Marilyn Monroe was included in Warhol's first show in New York, at the Stable Gallery in November 1962, where the architect Philip Johnson bought it. He eventually donated it to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, where it remains.[4][5]"
Brillo Soap Pads Boxes,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,sculpture,"Andy Warhol shocked people with his paintings of Campbell's soup cans, coupled with such provocative statements as: ""The reason I'm painting this way is because I want to be a machine."" By taking his imagery from advertising and the mass media, Warhol attacked the separation of art from mass culture. Unlike the corrugated cardboard originals represented in ""Brillo"", these sculptures are made of wood. By making the cartons non-functional and uprooting them from their ordinary context, Warhol forces us to look at them freshly. They comment on the way that commercial packaging transforms a mundane, household product into a glamorous, desirable commodity. Warhol also focuses our attention on the significance of these objects as representatives of the impersonal, commercialized consumer society in which we live."
Che Guevara,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,portrait,"This infamous Che Guevara painting is actually a forgery created by Gerard Malanga (who was in need of money) and sold to a gallery in Rome. When Warhol heard of the fraud, he ""authenticated"" the fake, provided that all the money from sales went to him."
Vote McGovern,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,"poster, portrait","Vote McGovern, also known as Vote McGovern, 1972,[1] is a colored lithograph by Andy Warhol. He produced it in support of George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. The print depicts a photograph of then-President of the United States Richard Nixon with his face dyed green and blue, and with his jacket and tie dyed pink and red, respectively.[2] Nixon was a Republican and McGovern the Democrats' candidate in the 1972 United States presidential election.

It was Warhol's first political poster[3] and has been described as Warhol's ""most overtly political work"".[2] The photograph of Nixon on which the print is based was taken from a photograph of him and his wife Pat Nixon on the cover of Newsweek; Warhol chose the colors used to dye Nixon's face based on those of Mrs. Nixon's dress.[3] Art critic Jonathan Jones described the print as follows: ""Nixon's face is acidic green, colliding shockingly with an orange background, almost like classical Indian art in its chromatic intensity. It captures the way Nixon in the flesh looked like a cartoon, his head too big for his body. But that's all in the way of satire.""[4] In 2016, it was featured in a printmaking exhibition at the British Museum.[3]"
Oxidation Painting,Warhol Andy,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"The ""Oxidation Paintings"" is a series of ""paintings"" done by coating canvases with wet copper paint and afterwards urinating on them, urine which oxidizes and changes color. In most cases, the urine does not belong to Warhol, but to his friends. According to Bob Colacello, Warhol once said: ""It's a parody of Jackson Pollock"", alluding to Pollock's legendary emission into Peggy Guggenheim's fireplace."
Speed Skater,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,poster,"Speed Skater is a 1983 work by the American artist Andy Warhol.,[1] made for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, then Yugoslavia.

Lazar 'Lazo' Vujic, a gallerist originally from Sarajevo and working in Vienna, invited 16 artists to produce a portfolio of artworks in honor of 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics. Vujic, who knew Warhol from earlier times, invited Warhol to a project. According to Vujic, Warhol asked who are the other artists and when he heard that Henry Moore was one of them, he immediately agreed to join the team. [2]

Other team members included David Hockney, Piero Dorazio, Henry Moore, Jean-Michel Folon, Giuseppe Santomaso, and Cy Twombly. Vujic's Visconti Fine Art gallery served as an official publisher. Each of the 16 artists produced one work associated with winter Olympics. Henry Moore made an image of Greek masks. Sports Illustrated commented it: ""Winter Olympics or not, we shouldn't forget the contributions of the ancient Greeks.""[3] Folon depicted a ski jumper jumping against the firmament. David Hockney's produced a photo collage of a figure skater. Glaser drew five rings landing on a Corinthian column. Cy Twombly's work is named Graffiti, with ""Yugoslavia"" and ""Olympics"" in Serbo-Croatian. Over the 1983/94 winter before the Olympics, the exhibit 'Art and Sport Edition' was shown by Vujic's Visconti Art Gallery in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Toronto, Detroit, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Vail, Aspen, Lake Tahoe, Denver, Indianapolis, Madison, and Minneapolis.[3]

Warhol made Speed Skater as a screenprint in colours on wove paper. It was made in an edition of 150 plus ten artist's proofs. He also made some unique variants as trial proofs, each printed with different positions of the colour screens.[4] Its sizes are 875 x 625 mm. The Speed Skater was used for the official Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster.[5]"
Magazine and History,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,mosaic,"Magazine and History is a 4.3-meter-high painting by Andy Warhol completed in 1983 and part of the Hubert Burda Media collection.[1][2]

It represent 25 covers of Bunte Magazine, a German weekly magazine that covers celebrity, gossip, news, and lifestyle matters.

Hubert Burda, owner of Bunte and Hubert Burda Media commissioned Warhol to create the artwork for the inauguration of the new offices of Bunte in Munich Arabellapark. The inauguration took place on December 4th, 1983 in presence of Andy Warhol.[3]

Hubert Burda had visited Warhol in New York City and commissioned him with several portraits.[4] He was impressed by his approach and his magazine Interview founded in 1969. It inspired him to modernize the format of Bunte magazine.[5][6]

In this print, each magazine cover is represented in a different color, acting as individual tesserae forming a different sort of multi-colored mosaic.

The painting was exhibited at the Museum of Urban and Contemporary Art (MUCA) of Munich in Die BUNTE Art exhibition in June 2018. Along Andy Warhol artwork, the exhibition included contemporary artists and photographers : Mirko Borsche, Carsten Fock, Roger Fritz, Hell Gette, Michael von Hassel , Olaf Nicolai, Anselm Reyle, Benjamin Roeder, Stefan Strumbel, Laurence de Valmy [fr], Mia Florentine Weiss and Wolfgang Wilde [7][8]"
Orange Prince,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,portrait,"Orange Prince (1984) is a painting by American artist Andy Warhol, of Prince, the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director based on an original photograph by Lynn Goldsmith. The painting is one of twelve silkscreen portraits on canvas of Prince created by Warhol in 1984. These paintings and four additional works on paper are collectively known as the Prince Series.[1] Each painting is unique and can be distinguished by colour.

Orange Prince (1984) is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy. Art historian and Warhol expert Thomas E. Crow believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.[2]

The Warhol portraits were not commissioned by Prince, but rather were made by Warhol for his private collection. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, a young star not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:

""(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the Factory entourage of the 1960s.""[2][3]"
Absolut Warhol (Absolut Vodka),Warhol Andy,Pop Art,advertisement,"In 1985 Warhol became the first artist commissioned to create a portrait of the Absolut Vodka bottle in what would become one of the most successful advertising campaigns of the twentieth century. Following the triumph of the [i]Absolut Warhol[/i] ads, the president of the company that owned Absolut, Michael Roux, encouraged Warhol to suggest other artists that could be used in the campaign. Over the years more than three hundred and fifty artists have been commissioned, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/absolut-haring-1986]Keith Haring[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/absolut-ruscha-1988]Ed Ruscha[/url] - both suggested by Warhol. In 1988, alongside the famous names, Roux began selecting less well-known artists, viewing the commission as an opportunity to launch their career. Interestingly, although Warhol never usually drank alcohol, he did use Absolut as a perfume."
Self-Portrait,Warhol Andy,Pop Art,self-portrait,"Comprising solely of a flat, vibrant fiery-red silkscreen image of Warhol emblazoned like a single and dramatic paint-splash over the black void of the canvas, this vast, nearly three-metre-square Self-Portrait is an imposing, haunting and ultimately poignant work from Warhol's great last series of self-portraits made in 1986. One of what is believed to be only five versions (green, blue, purple, yellow and here, red), made on this monumental scale, this vast but simple, even in some ways minimalist, image of the artist's famous but time-worn face peering tentatively out from under the wild hair of his instantly-recognizable 'fright-wig' is one of the great self-portrait images of the Twentieth Century. A comparatively rare self-exposure, the painting is a typically seamless fusion of painting and photography within one instantly unforgettable image. A vast, and somewhat morbid, icon of an icon, it is also, like so many artists' late self-portraits throughout history, a timeless portrait of a visibly aging master confronting the inevitability of his own imminent disappearance from the light of existence, in death. 

Warhol’s last series of self-portraits are among the most iconic, moving and ultimately profound works of his entire career. Among the very last paintings he executed before he did indeed suffer a premature and unexpected death - following complications that arose after a routine operation on his gall bladder in February 1987 - this series of self-portraits have consequently gained a prescience and an uncanny sense of timeliness that has done much to reinforce the legend of Warhol as a modern-day seer. The 'somewhat unearthly... and terrifying oracle' as Calvin Tomkins once described him, who 'made visible what was happening in some part to us all', seems here, in these works, to be foreseeing intimations of his own death. (Calvin Tomkins, 'Raggedy Andy' in Andy Warhol exh. cat., Eindhoven. 1970. p. 10.)"
The Marriage of the Virgin,Raphael,High Renaissance,religious painting,"Raphael completed this painting in 1504 for the Citta de Castello, a Franciscan Church. The image, as the name implies, illustrates the wedding between Mary and Joseph. Instead of a biblical scene, the story depicted by Raphael is only a legend. According to the legend, Mary had so many suitors that the High Priest developed a test to see who was the worthiest to wed the woman. Every available man was given a dry rod to place on altar in front of Mary. Whereas none of the other rods flowered, Joseph’s did, and he was able to obtain her hand in marriage."
The School of Athens,Raphael,High Renaissance,history painting,"The School of Athens fresco, which is one of Raphael’s most famous works, was completed to decorate the Stanza della Segnatura commission by the Pope. The Stanza was the first set of rooms to be decorated, and this painting was the second in the set of paintings that adorn the walls. Although it was created for a grand room in the Vatican, nearly every one of the figures in the painting can be identified as a Greek philosopher, rather than a religious character. Raphael included the likeness of Michelangelo himself in the painting, as the philosopher Heraclitus."
The Triumph of Galatea,Raphael,High Renaissance,mythological painting,"Raphael completed this work for the Villa Farnesina, a suburban Renaissance villa in Rome in 1512. The Farnesina was built by one of the richest men of the early Renaissance, Agostini Chigi, who was a banker. This was the only painting of Greek mythology that Raphael painted, the story of the Nereid Galatea, who had fallen in love with a peasant shepherd, Acis. Galatea’s consort, after finding the two lovers in an embrace, killed Acis by throwing a giant pillar at him. Although Raphael’s painting is based off of the story, it does not illustrate any of the actual events of the story."
Portrait of Pope Julius II,Raphael,High Renaissance,portrait,"The portrait shows Giuliano della Rovere, Pope Julius II, elected in 1503 after one of the shortest conclaves ever (he bribed everyone). He was a lover of war, who led his own armies; and a lover of art, commissioning some of the greatest works in western history: Raphael's decorated rooms in the Vatican and Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling. The presentation of the subject was unusual for its time: previous Papal portraits showed them frontally or kneeling in profile. It was also exceptional at this period to show the sitter so evidently in a particular mood. In fact, Julius was depressed because the city of Bologna had seceded from the papal states. He expressed his grief at this political disaster by growing a beard, imitating what Renaissance humanists had discovered was an ancient form of mourning. It is the beard that enables this portrait to be dated 1511-12. The intimacy of this image was unprecedented in Papal portraiture, but became the model, followed by most future painters, including Sebastiano del Piombo and Diego Velázquez.

The Portrait of a Young Woman (La Fornarina),Raphael,High Renaissance,portrait,"Raphael never married. Although he was engaged for a short time, he was unmotivated to wed, and the bride-to-be died before they were wed. He did, however, have a long-time mistress, Margherita Luti, who was the daughter of a baker. X-ray analysis of the painting has revealed that the background of the painting was originally painted as a myrtle bush, which was considered a symbol of love and passion. According to Vasari, in his biography of Raphael, his death was brought on by a sudden illness, which was caused by a night of excessive sex with Luti. Being embarrassed and not disclosing this fact to his doctors, he subsequently received the wrong treatment and died two weeks later."
The Transfiguration,Raphael,High Renaissance,religious painting,"Considered the last painting by Raphael, The Transfiguration was incomplete at the time of his death. It is generally thought that Raphael’s pupil, Giulio Romano, completed the rest of the painting in 1520. Raphael began the high altarpiece in 1516, which was commissioned by Cardinal Giulio de Medici, who later became Pope Clement VII. At the time it was commissioned, Raphael was busy with many other works, so de Medici commissioned another work, The Raising of Lazarus, to make him work faster. After Raphael’s death, de Medici kept the painting, which later taken by French troops to Paris in 1797. It was retuned in 1815, however, and it has been safe at the Vatican, its present location, ever since."
Boy with a Basket of Fruit,Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",portrait,"Caravaggio completed this painting when he was new to Rome and relatively unknown in the art world. The model for the boy in painting was Caravaggio’s good friend Mario Minniti, who was 16 at the time, and who would serve as one of his models many times in the future. As a realist painter, Caravaggio did not idealize his paintings, instead he captured the very essence of what he saw on the canvas in front of him. This is beautifully clear in his portrayals of the fruit and leaves in the basket, which are so realistic that they have been analyzed by horticultural scientists, who were able to accurately determine the individual cultivars."
Medusa,Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",mythological painting,"Caravaggio (1571-1610) painted two versions of the Head of Medusa. The first in 1596 and the other presumably in 1597/8. The first version also known as Murtula, due to the poet who wrote about it (48x55 cm) is signed Michel A F, (Michel Angelo Fecit) and was found on the painter’s studio only after his dead. Nowadays it belongs to a private collection whilst the second version, slightly bigger (60 x 55 cm) is not signed and it is in the Uffizi Gallery, in Florence. 
The “Head of Medusa” executed by Caravaggio, in 1598, was commissioned as a cerimonial shield by Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, the Medici family’s agent in Rome, after seeing, on the painters studio, the first version – The Metula painting. The purpose of this commissioned was to symbolize the Grand Duke of Tuscany's courage in defeating his enemies. For its subject matter, Caravaggio drew on the Greek myth of Medusa, a woman with snakes for hair who turned people to stone by looking at them. 
Medusa was a Gorgon monster, a terrifying female creature from the Greek Mythology. While descriptions of Gorgons vary across Greek literature, the term commonly refers to any of three sisters who had hair of living, venomous snakes, and a horrifying visage that turned those who beheld it to stone. Traditionally, while two of the Gorgons were immortal, Stheno and Euryale , their sister Medusa was not, and was slain by the mythical hero Perseus, the legendary founder of Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty. According to the story, she was killed by Perseus, who avoided direct eye contact by using a mirrored shield. After Medusa’s death, her decapitated head continued to petrify those that looked at it. 
Caravaggio plays with this concept by modeling himself for Medusa’s face – making him the only one who is safe from Medusa’s dedly gaze – and having to look at his reflection to paint the shield in the same way that Medusa caught her own image moments before being killed. Although Caravaggio depicts Medusa’s severed head, she remains conscious. He heightens this combination of life and death through Medusa’s intense expression. Her wide-open mouth exudes a silent but dramatic scream and her shocked eyes and furrowed brow all suggest a sense of disbelief, as if she thought herself to be invincible until the moment. But Caravaggio’s Medusa does not have the full effect of scaring the viewer, since she does not look at us, thereby transferring the power of the gaze to the viewer and emphasizing her demise. Caravaggio displays huge technical achievements in this work by making a convex surface look concave and Medusa’s head appear to project outward."
Judith Beheading Holofernes,Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",religious painting,"This painting tells the story Biblical story of Judith, who saved her people by seducing and beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes, which was a common theme in the 16th century. The same story has also been painted by artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Donatello, Artemesia Gentileshi, Giorgione, and Andrea Mantegna. In typical Caravaggio style, the painting depicts the moment of greatest impact, when Judith, whose emotions ring clear on her distraught face, physically beheads the Assyrian king. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio changed the position of Holofernes’ head as he was painting, separating it farther from the body."
The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew,Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",religious painting,"Caravaggio completed both Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Calling of Saint Matthew, his first two publicly commissioned works, for the Contarelli Chapel in Rome in 1600. This painting marks the exact time when the orthodox Mannerism gave way to Baroque emotionality, and immediately catapulted Caravaggio into stardom. The scene was specifically requested by Cardinal Contarelli before his death, and that the painting should require three things: the saint being murdered by a soldier, onlookers showing emotions of shock and disgust, and architecture as the background element. The painting, upon being x-rayed, shows evidence that Caravaggio attempted two different compositions before completing the one we see today, eventually eliminating the architectural element entirely."
Amor Victorious,Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",mythological painting,"Cupid, the god of love stand upon the trampled symbols of music, science, war, and government, illustrating Virgil’s line: “love conquers all; let us all yield to love!” Caravaggio’s depiction of Cupid, rather than the cherub-like, idealized boy, is realistic, from the crooked grin to the tousled head of hair. The painting was commissioned by a rich patron Vincenzo Guistanini, who retained it in his possession and reportedly loved it above all others. The painting was an immediate success, and inspired contemporary artworks, including poems and epigrams along the same theme."
The Death of the Virgin,Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",religious painting,"Death of the Virgin was commissioned by a wealthy papal lawyer for his chapel in Trastevere, Rome, in 1601. Upon completion, it was deemed unfit for the parish, who rejected the depiction of the dead body of Mary. Other reports say the painting was unfit for the parish because of Mary’s bare legs. It was also a controversial piece because Caravaggio is said to have used a prostitute, one of his most common models, as the model for the Virgin Mary. Either way, it was later bought by the Duke of Mantua, after hearing from Peter Paul Rubens that it was one of Caravaggio’s best works"
John the Baptist (Reclining Baptist),Caravaggio,"Baroque, Tenebrism",religious painting,"Believed to be his last painting, Caravaggio's ""John the Baptist Reclining"" is barely known by comparison to his other pieces. This is due to disputes that arose after Caravaggio's death regarding the attribution of the piece as a work of the great master. The painting was discovered in Argentina; it is now in a private collection in Munich. The reasons for thinking it may be by Caravaggio, apart from the style and subject matter, are as follows: in July 1610, following news of Caravaggio's death, the bishop of Caserta wrote to Cardinal Scipione Borghese that three paintings by the artist were in the Naples palazzo of the Marchesa of Caravaggio. They were two Saint Johns and a Magdalene. The paintings had been intended for Borghese and he instructed the Marchesa to look after them for him. Unfortunately for Borghese they were seized two days later by the head of the Knights of Malta in Naples, on the grounds that Caravaggio was a knight of the Order and all his possessions devolved on the Knights - which all involved must have known to be untrue, as Caravaggio had been expelled from the Order in 1608. The newly arrived Spanish Viceroy of Naples heard of the affair, but, believing the paintings were in Porto Ercole, wrote to the head of the Spanish garrison there telling him that the Knights had no right to them and that they should be returned to the Viceroy, ""in particular the painting of John the Baptist."" There is no certain knowledge of what happened to the various paintings after that point. Cardinal Borghese got the “Youth with a Ram”, but more than a year later. The other two paintings - the Magdalene and the second Baptist - disappeared, but it is possible, though unproven, that the Viceroy may have managed to secure the other Baptist. He would presumably have taken it back to Spain, and from there it could have made its way to South America. All this, however, is speculation - it needs to be pointed out that no-one knows the exact identity of the paintings involved."
The Farm,Miro Joan,"Cubism, Naïve Art (Primitivism)",landscape,"A dramatically tilted picture plane presents the viewer with a glimpse of a busy Spanish masia or ""family farm."" Miró wrote of this work, ""The Farm was a résumé of my entire life in the country. I wanted to put everything I loved about the country into that canvas-from a huge tree to a tiny snail."" The artist spent sometimes as many as eight hours a day for nine months working on this painting, for which he then struggled to find a buyer in a Parisian modern art market crazy for Cubism. In The Farm, Miró combines an interest in primitivism, perhaps harkening back to his attraction to Catalan folk art, and a Cubist vocabulary to produce a strangely haunting landscape that prefigures his Surrealist work. His almost maniacal attention to detail where carefully rendered objects are displayed against stark, monochromatic expanses of space makes for an unsettling contrast. Flattened forms exist side-by-side with carefully rendered and modeled objects, a testament to the influence of Cézanne and the Cubists."
The Ear of Grain,Miro Joan,"Cubism, Surrealism",still life,"""The Ear of Grain"" is an early work in which Miró demonstrates his close study of everyday objects, in some ways a by-product of study in a traditional academic setting. As a young artist, Miró was influenced by the painstaking, detailed realism of the Dutch Masters. The attention he gives to objects is reflected later in the care Miró takes with constructing the clean-edged, biomorphic forms of his trademark style."
The Tilled Field,Miro Joan,Surrealism,landscape,"Populated with complex, often inscrutable forms, The Tilled Field, with its puzzling iconography, is an abstract depiction of the landscape of Miró's Catalan homeland. The painting, teeming with organic forms that merge and meld seemingly in defiance of nature, is a testament to Miró's ever-increasing stylization and abstraction at this point in his career. The picture may be viewed as both an homage to Spain's past and a statement on the political upheaval in Europe. In subtle ways, Miró's works frequently expressed his own political sentiments as does this one as well as works from the period leading up to and throughout World War II. The painting also emphasizes how extremely radical was Miró's departure from his previous, naturalist style once he arrived in Paris and was exposed to the avant-garde art of that city in which innovation thrived."
Maternity,Miro Joan,"Surrealism, Automatic Painting",figurative,"The composition of Maternity is very schematic: reduced to its simplest forms, the female figure is scarcely recognizable in this painting. With one breast in profile and the other frontally depicted, almost moon-like, she nurses two stick-figure children as they hover in mid-air. Miró's interest in abstraction and the bizarre is evident as he takes a typical motif of Mother and Child and eliminates any element of realism. However, with the title, Maternity, Miró suggests that what remains after stripping away excess representation are the instinctual and emotional aspects of the relationship between mother and child that may not be evident in more naturalistic depictions."
Woman (Opera Singer),Miro Joan,Surrealism,figurative,"Miró assigned this pastel the title Woman, aiming for something ""unpretentious and very ordinary,"" he said, but the work has come to be known as Opera Singer because of the figure's open mouth and what is often identified as sheet music in her right hand. She is rendered in acidic, highly saturated, and dissonant colors, with flagrantly displayed genitalia."
Painting,Miro Joan,Surrealism,abstract,"In the late twenties Miró questioned paint as a medium and began to search for new vehicles of expression. Later, while working on his paintings on masonite, he grew aware of certain poetic qualities inherent in the material and sensed their aesthetic potential.
Miró was in pursuit of the interpenetration of materials, which often appears imposed by force. The contrast of the materials (casein, black shoe polish, tar and sand, in addition to oil colours) and the rough support of the ""masonite"" express the violence of the execution."
The Beautiful Bird Revealing the Unknown to a Pair of Lovers (from the Constellation series),Miro Joan,Surrealism,abstract,"In his Constellations series of 1940-1, Miró set about to create new challenges in composition and then to solve them. One from this series of ten multi-media works on paper, The Beautiful Bird Revealing the Unknown to a Pair of Lovers, features a reducedpalette, including a solid background that emphasizes the simplified forms and lines that together mimic the appearance of a complex constellation in the night sky. In the midst of producing this series, Miró was forced to flee with his family from France to Mallorca to escape advancing German troops. Evidently the family took little else with them aside from these paintings. The crowded, chaotic feeling of these compositions in some ways echo Miró'sfeelings regarding the violent upheaval in Europe at the time."
Study for A Sunday on La Grande Jatte,Seurat Georges ,"Pointillism, Neo-Impressionism",genre painting,"Seurat's famous painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (Art Institute of Chicago) debuted at the 1886 Impressionist exhibition in Paris. He had begun the work two years earlier, completing more than fifty studies, including this one. Upon Pissarro's advice, Seurat painted the final canvas with pigments that proved unstable and soon lost their luster. Thus the present study provides a vital record of the chromatic intensity he had hoped to achieve."
Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,Seurat Georges ,"Pointillism, Neo-Impressionism",genre painting,"This most famous and influential [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neo-impressionism]Neo-Impressionist[/url] work depicts a cross-section of Paris society enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park on an island in the Seine River just at the gates of Paris. Sunday was the time that middle-class Parisians escaped the city to enjoy the outdoors. The people primarily gather in small groups of two or three or sit alone in proximity to others. It is the relationship between these people that creates a sense of modernity, with its distance and disconnection, and nervous tension that lends the work an air of mystery.

Using a grid system and applying small dots of paint, Seurat took two years to complete this large-scale painting. He went to the park often, observing and making over 60 preliminary studies, including 15 in oil. Invoking Greek classical art, Seurat explained, ""The Panathenaeans of Phidias formed a procession. I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color."" Seurat hoped to capture the permanence, or essential forms, behind the fleeting moments. Everyone here is caught in a still pose, except for the child in the orange dress skipping off into the trees, the man on the far left playing trombone, and the furious little dog at the lower right. However, it seems a stillness that might burst into movement at any moment, just as the upper half of the painting moves into the sunlight and the boats in the distance cut across the river. While Seurat invoked classical and Egyptian figures, some have interpreted the overall static effect of the composition and the stiffness of the poses as a critique of the artificiality of modern society and the boredom of middle-class life."
The Vision after the Sermon (Jacob wrestling with the Angel),Gauguin Paul ,"Synthetism, Cloisonnism",religious painting,"One of the most famous works by Paul Gauguin, [i]Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel[/i] (1888) was painted during the artist's stay in Pont-Aven, Brittany. The painting refers to the biblical story of Jacob, who crossed the river Jabbok and spent the night wrestling a mysterious angel. The artist depicts the subject indirectly, showing a group of Breton women after a sermon in church. The women moved by the sermon see a vision of Jacob wrestling the angel.

The available information about the painting comes primarily from two sources: letters written by Gauguin and writings by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard]Emile Bernard[/url]. Bernard spent the summer of 1888 with Gauguin in Pont-Aven – the two worked side by side, and while Gauguin painted [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i] Bernard worked on the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard/breton-women-in-the-meadow-1888][i]Breton Women in the Meadow[/i][/url] (1888). The two paintings share stylistic similarities and are both examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Both artists also shared an affinity for Japanese art, and Bernard wrote that the motif of [i]Jacob wrestling the angel in Vision After the Sermon[/i] was modeled after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Hokusai[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/all-works#!#filterName:Theme_sumo-wrestlers,resultType:masonry]Sumo Wrestlers[/url].

Gauguin used the term [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetism]Synthetism[/url] to describe paintings such as [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], in which he aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist’s emotional response to the subject, and the aesthetic considerations of line, form, and color. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], Gauguin creates a synthesis between two realities: the everyday life of the Breton women and their vision of the biblical event. In a letter to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url], he wrote about the sermon that inspired the painting: “For me, the landscape and the fight only exist in the imagination of the people praying after the sermon which is why there is a contrast between the life-size people and the struggle in its non-natural disproportionate landscape”. For this reason, Gauguin emphasized the contrast between the dramatic fight scene and the serenity of the women quietly praying.

By weaving together different Christian symbols, Gauguin added new content and meaning to the religious subject. In the foreground, he depicted twelve Breton women in prayer, a symbolic reference to Jacob’s twelve sons, the predecessors of the twelve tribes of Israel. The apple tree in the center of the composition was another non-traditional addition to the story of Jacob. In the bible, the apple tree is a symbol of knowledge, a reference to man’s awakening, and subsequently his fall from grace. In [i]Vision After the Sermon[/i], the apple tree is full and lush, suggesting the possibility of man’s redemption and a possible return to paradise. Another important component is the bull emerging from the left corner of the painting. The bull is possibly a sacrificial animal, and as such, it can hint to the sacrifice of Christ and the chance for redemption. The bull is also connected to Breton, it is a symbol attributed to four Breton saints. In this way, Gauguin formed a connection between his unique symbolism and the spirituality of the devout Breton women."
Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers,Gauguin Paul ,Cloisonnism,portrait,"Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh had an early friendship, which blossomed into an invitation to Arles, France, where van Gogh wanted Gauguin to stay with him and create an art colony. This painting was completed during Gauguin’s stay in Arles, depicting van Gogh painting his famous work Sunflowers. Unfortunately, Gaugin and Van Gogh were unable to create their art colony, as Gauguin only stayed for two months. The pair quarreled, and in December of 1888, Gauguin confronted van Gogh with a razor blade. Van Gogh, panicking, fled to a brothel, where he cut off his lower left ear lobe. Gauguin later left and the two never saw each other again."
Self Portrait with Halo and Snake,Gauguin Paul ,Cloisonnism,self-portrait,"[i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] (1889) is a unique and radical [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait]self-portrait[/url] in the artist’s body of work. His [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]interest in self-portraiture[/url] was especially pronounced in 1888 and 1889, in part because of his relationship with his fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url]. Gauguin stayed with Van Gogh in Arles for two months in 1888, and afterward, the two continued to exchange artistic ideas through correspondence.

Painted on a cupboard door, [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] presents an image that is both angelic and demonic. The artist includes three Christian symbols in the painting – the yellow halo over his head, the apples that dangle from a branch on the left, and the snake which he holds in his right hand. Together these symbols reference the biblical story of the Temptation of Adam and Eve and the Fall of Man. By combining these symbols, Gauguin presents himself as both a saint and a sinner or a figure of a fallen angel. This duality is also evident in the composition of the painting: the top half depicts Gauguin with the halo looking away from the temptation (apples) while the bottom half shows grasping the snake. The image possibly reflects the artist’s inner struggle as well as the enigmatic way in which he wished to portray himself to others.

In the painting, there is no sense of spatial dimension, and the large areas of flat colors demonstrate the influence of Japanese prints and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism]Cloisonnism[/url] – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Another important influence in [i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting]ancient Egyptian art[/url] and imagery. The shape of Gauguin’s long hair is similar to the ceremonial wigs of Egyptian gods, Pharaohs, and court officials. Gauguin was familiar with these conventions through the plaster cast of the Giza [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/khafre-enthroned--2570]sculpture of The Pharaoh Khephren[/url] at the Ethnographic Museum of Trocadéro and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/the-goddess-hathor-welcomes-sethos-i--1069]Relief from the Tomb of Sethos I[/url] at the Louvre. The Egyptian influence is also evident in the way Gauguin paints the hand and the snake. The snake was possibly modeled after the snake symbol featured on Pharaoh’s personal emblem on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-egyptian-painting/stele-of-the-serpent-king-stela-of-djet--3000]Stela of Djet[/url] at the Louvre. The grasp of the snake is not realistic, and the hand is depicted from a frontal view which is characteristic of Egyptian reliefs and wall paintings. In the foreground of the painting, Gauguin added an ornamental element of a vine-like plant or flower. The vines could have been modeled after the lotus and the papyrus plant, that were often featured on Egyptian reliefs, sculptures, and wall paintings.  

[i]Self-portrait with Halo and Snake[/i] is a companion piece to [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/portrait-of-meyer-de-haan-by-lamplight-1889]i]Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan[/i][/url] (1889). The two works were intended to be part of a decorative panel in Gauguin’s dwelling in the village Le Pouldu. The companion portrait depicts Gauguin’s close friend, the Dutch painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/meijer-de-haan]Meijer de Haan[/url] in the pose of a thinker. The redhaired painter is staring at two books, John Milton’s [i]Paradise Lost[/i] and Thomas Carlyle’s [i]Sartor Resartus[/i], contemplating issues of religion and philosophy. Some have suggested that the portraits address similar themes through different references: both present the artist in a sort of inner struggle and as figures that have a strong connection to the spiritual and mystical realm."
Yellow Christ,Gauguin Paul ,Cloisonnism,allegorical painting,"The Yellow Christ, in addition to The Green Christ, also painted by Gaugin, is said to be one of the key works in Cloisonnism. The Christ in the painting is a direct representation of a crucifix in Pont-Avon, France, where Gaugin visited to paint a number of times. It depicts a yellow form of Christ being crucified in 19th century northern France. French Breton women gather around the cross in prayer. The only shading in the painting is of the women bowed in prayer, the figure of Christ on the cross clearly outlined in black, and his form is flat, typical of the Gaugin’s symbolic style."
Ia Orana Maria (We Hail Thee Mary),Gauguin Paul ,Cloisonnism,allegorical painting,"[i]Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary)[/i] (1891) was the first major canvas Paul Gaugin painted in Tahiti. He traveled there in 1891 seeking a wild tropical paradise free from the constraints of modern society. The artist soon discovered that this ‘primitive paradise’ did not exist, and instead he witnessed the impact of French colonial policies that the suppression of Polynesian native culture, customs, and religious beliefs.

In [i]Ia Orana Maria[/i] Gauguin subtly addressed this tension by translating the traditional Christian subject to a Polynesian setting. The painting depicts an encounter between two Tahitian women and a visionary Madonna and Child. The women pay homage to the Madonna and Child, greeting them with words written in Roman characters at the bottom left of the painting ‘Ia Orana Maria’. ‘Ia Orana’ is a common salutation in Tahiti, meaning that the title of the painting translates to the greeting ‘Hello Mary’ or ‘Hail Mary’. Next to the two women is the figure of an angel with golden wings that are separated and partially concealed by a flowering bush. This arrangement is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/the-vision-after-the-sermon-jacob-wrestling-with-the-angel-1888][i]Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel[/i][/url] (1888), in which the tree trunk in the center of the composition separates the angel from the devout Bretton women. While the Tahitian setting is lusher and more colorful, the two paintings share the principle of combining everyday life with supernatural elements.

[i]Ia Orana Maria[/i] is an example of Gauguin’s ability to fuse different cultural influences: Christian iconography with references to non-Western (Polynesian, Javanese, Japanese) cultures. Gauguin often relied on reproductions and photographs as sources for his paintings, and these visuals were often essential to his artistic practice. One of these photographs was of the Buddhist temple of Borobudur on the island of Java. The photo shows two sculptured friezes, [i]Monks on the Benares Road[/i] at the top and [i]The Arrival of Maitrakanyaka at Nandana[/i] at the bottom. Gauguin appropriated elements from the frieze to the composition of [i]Ia Orana Maria[/i]: he used the two male figures from the left side of the top frieze as the basis for the female worshipers who pay homage to the Tahitian Virgin and Child. He also altered the clothing and covered the women’s bodies with Tahitian pareos and drapery. By combining different sources and adjusting them into a new structure, Gauguin was able to transform the creations of other artists into his own. The figures from the temple of Borobudur continued to be an inspiration for the artist in later works such as the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/tahitian-pastoral][i]Faa Iheihe[/i][/url] (1898) and the woodcut [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/change-of-residence-1899][i]Changement de résidence (Change of Residence)[/i][/url] (1899).

Gauguin described [i]Ia Orana Maria[/i] in detail in a letter from March 1892 commenting that he was pleased with the painting. He also reproduced the motif of Madonna and Child from the painting into other mediums, such as the zincograph [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/ia-orana-maria-hail-mary-1895][i]Ia Orana Maria[/i[/url]] (1894) and charcoal drawing [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/hail-mary-ia-orana-maria-1895][i]Ia Orana Maria[/i][/url] (1895), that he dedicated to Neo-Impressionist artist and patron Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld."
The Spirit of the Dead Watches,Gauguin Paul ,Post-Impressionism,nude painting (nu),"In 1891, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] artist Paul Gauguin left France to travel to the island of Tahiti. For Gauguin, the tropical island held the promise of a ‘primitive paradise’, that was free from the constraints of modern society. However, once he arrived, Gauguin realized that the place he envisioned did not exist: the island was dealing with the impacts of colonialism and modernity, and native customs and culture seemed to be headed towards extinction. In his art, he tried to reimagine this lost paradise and experience the native Polynesian culture and customs.

[i]Spirit of the Dead Watching (Manaò Tupapaú)[/i] (1892) was one of the artist’s best-known works from his[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_1st-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry] first visit to Tahiti[/url]. The painting depicts a young Tahitian girl haunted by the Tupapaú, the Polynesian spirit of the dead. The girl in the painting was Teha’amana, Gauguin’s young lover, and ‘native-wife’. In his Tahiti journals [i]Noa Noa[/i], he described the incident that inspired the painting: “One day I had to go to Papeete… I had promised to return that very evening…  It was one in the morning by the time I arrived… The lamp had gone out and when I came home the bedroom was dark. I felt a sort of fear… I struck some matches and saw [what I pictured in my painting Manaò] Tupapaú.” Frightened by the spirits, Teha’amana lies naked on her stomach rigid and tense while glancing sideways toward the viewer.

In [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] Gauguin wanted to represent the Polynesian fear of the Tupapaú, who is depicted as an older woman wearing a black cloak. On the back wall, there are several white forms, that Gauguin described as phosphorescent lights, which symbolize the spirits that haunt the living. Gauguin depicted the figure of the Tupapaú in a similar fashion in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/words-of-the-devil-1892][i]Parau na te Varua ino (Words of the Devil)[/i][/url] (1892). In both cases, the artist juxtaposed the fearful nude figure with the Tupapaú: the Tupapaú is painted in cool tones that contrast the warm shades of the female nudes.

The painting also closely relates to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Édouard Manet[/url], a painting Gauguin greatly admired and even took a photograph of it with him to Tahiti. In the same way that Manet’s [i]Olympia[/i] represented a modern incarnation of Venus, Gauguin wanted to showcase his version of a native Venus. This connection was also established by Gauguin’s European contemporaries, the French writer Alfred Jarry called her ‘a brown Olympia’. [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] was important to Gauguin, he made several versions of the motif in drawings and woodblocks and even featured it in the background of the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/self-portrait-in-a-hat][i]Self-portrait in a Hat[/i][/url] (1893).

As new discourses developed, Gauguin’s [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] prompted new readings and interpretations. Gauguin described his relationship with then thirteen-year-old Teha’amana through the contrasts of youth and old age, of light and darkness and life and death. Given the fact that Gauguin was an older man in the position of taking advantage of his subject, the story behind [i]Spirit of the Dead Watching[/i] can take on a different meaning. Did the spirits cause Teha’amana uneasiness or was she frightened by someone she sees beyond the picture plane?"
Day of the Gods,Gauguin Paul ,Cloisonnism,allegorical painting,"When Gauguin returned to France in 1893, he spent most of his time in Paris promoting his work and writing and illustrating Noa Noa, a fictionalized account of his Tahitian experience. Day of the Gods (Mahana No Atua), one of the very few paintings Gauguin completed during this period, is closely related to his literary project. Set in a Tahitian landscape by the sea, the composition is divided into three horizontal bands. At the top, islanders perform a ritual near a towering sculpture. Like many figures in Gauguin’s Tahitian images, the monumental sculpture was derived not from local religion but from photographs of carved reliefs adorning the Buddhist temple complex at Borobudur (Java). In the middle band, three symmetrically arranged figures are placed against a field of pink earth in poses that may signify birth, life, and death. The woman in the center, formally linked to the sculpture at the top, is similar in appearance to other depictions of Tahitian females who Gauguin used to suggest the Christian figure of Eve in paradise. The lower portion of the composition evokes brilliant, contrasting hues reflected in the water. Gauguin’s Post-Impressionist style, defined by a decreasing tendency to depict real objects and the expressive use of flat, curving shapes of vibrant color, influenced many abstract painters of the early 20th century."
Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?,Gauguin Paul ,Post-Impressionism,allegorical painting,"The monumental painting [i]Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i] (1897-98) was created in Tahiti during a time of the artist's great personal crisis. Struggling to find recognition and success in Paris, Gauguin decided to move permanently to Tahiti in 1895. There he continued to struggle: plagued by illness and mounting debt, his mental health rapidly deteriorated. Around the same time, he learned that his beloved daughter Aline died of pneumonia. At this low point, he summoned his strength to paint [i]Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?[/i], a masterpiece that was a summation of his artistic ideas. He wrote: “I have put all my energy into it one more time before I die, so painful a passion in such dreadful circumstances, so clear and accurate a vision, that there is no trace of precociousness and life blossoms forth from it”.

The painting, which should be viewed from right to left, represents the spectrum of human activity throughout one’s life, from birth to death. The thread of the composition corresponds with the questions posed in the title of the painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? The boundaries of the scene are marked by the newborn child lying in the grass on the right, and the haggard old woman, who glumly reflects on the past. Between these two, Gauguin creates a dreamlike vision that describes the daily existence of adulthood. In the background, he included a couple walking and an exotic blue idol, which, according to Gauguin, symbolized ‘the Beyond'. The large canvas features some of Gauguin’s favorite subjects, such as the reclining nude, the group of figures lost in thought, and the cult statue.

The painting expressed Gauguin’s highly personal mythology, which was developed through the combination and adaption of symbols from a variety of Western and non-Western sources. In particular, the scene reflects the influence of Tahiti, its tropical landscape, and native Polynesian culture. Gauguin wanted the painting to evoke associative meanings, rather than explain explicitly the meaning of his symbolism. His symbolism expressed the inner world of visions and emotions, which was purposefully enigmatic and ambiguous. Gauguin wanted to interpret life as a great mystery, and in the painting, he emphasized the lack of understanding of the world.

After he completed the painting, Gauguin sent it to Paris to the art collector George-Daniel de Monfreid. Shortly after the artist retreated to the hills where he intended to poison himself by drinking arsenic. Gauguin’s suicide attempt failed, and he gradually recovered in the hospital. In the meantime, Monfried managed to sell the painting for a thousand francs, something that helped Gauguin’s spirits. Today the painting is part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston."
Bathers,Gauguin Paul ,Cloisonnism,nude painting (nu),"The setting of this painting resembles Gauguin's 1897 work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/de/paul-gauguin/landscape-with-two-goats-1897][i]Landscape with two goats[/i][/url], but it is much brighter in colour and adds multiple people to the scene. The pose of the main male figure is likely modeled after a figure used by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/de/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url] in three paintings called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/de/paul-cezanne/bathers-at-rest-1877][i]Bathers at Rest[/i][/url].

The name of the painting derives from this similarity. However, it is also frequently called [i]Tahitian Family[/i] ([i]Famille tahitienne[/i]), although Gauguin had left Tahiti already in 1901. Disappointed by the increasing Europeanisation of his paradise, he sought refuge on the island of Hiva Oa, where this painting was created. Occasionally, it is also listed as [i]A Walk by the Sea[/i] ([i]Promenade au bord de la mer[/i]).

Going West,Pollock Jackson ,Expressionism,figurative,"One of his earlier works, Going West is an example of Pollock’s early interests and painting style, as well as his own personal history. It has been suggested that this painting was inspired by a family photo of a bridge in Pollock’s birthplace, Cody, Wyoming. As an image of a pioneering family moving west, perhaps it is also a personal statement of the fact that his family moved west to Arizona and then later California when he was a child. The painting also exhibits the influence on Pollock’s style by his mentor Thomas Hart Benton, who was an American Regionalist painter."
Mural,Pollock Jackson ,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"Jackson Pollock’s Mural represents the break from representational painting on traditional canvases to his unique drip style, completed on canvases stretched out on the floor. He assimilated painting techniques from Pablo Picasso, Thomas Hart Benton, and David Alfaro Siquieros, as well as Native American sand painting techniques to form his own unique drip style, which sometimes included sand or chards of glass, combined with enamel house paint, loosely dripped, squirted, and flung across his canvas or board. This painting, commissioned by Peggy Guggenheim, measured around 8 by 20 feet, and was Pollock’s first large-scale work completed in this manner."
Number 5,Pollock Jackson ,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"Jackson Pollock’s paintings are no strangers to high prices at auction, and his Number 5 is no different. In November of 2006, Number 5, painted in Pollock’s unique drip technique, was sold for $140 million dollars, the highest price ever paid at auction for a painting, to an unknown buyer. This price exceeded both the high price paid for his Blue Poles, which sold in 1973, as well as Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, which previously held the high price record.  Using his entire body to paint in a method called “action painting,” Pollock dripped and splattered layer upon layer of paint to create his chaotic patterns."
Number 1 (Lavender Mist),Pollock Jackson ,Action painting,abstract,"Through his drip action technique, Pollock would create layers upon layers of paint, created in a chaotic assemblage of drips and splashes. Physicists have studied Pollock’s canvases, such as Lavender Mist, for fractals, which naturally occur out of chaos. Chaos is defined as an irregularity of motion or shape that naturally arises from deterministic forces (such as painting). Some art scientists, such as Richard Taylor, have determined that the more chaotic Pollock’s drippings became, the closer they resembled naturally occurring fractals, and that his chronologically later paintings displayed these characteristics more so than his earlier works, which were less chaotic."
Blue poles (Number 11),Pollock Jackson ,Action painting,abstract,"More properly known as Blue Poles: Number 11, 1952, this painting is considered Pollock’s most important work. In 1973, it was purchased at auction for $2 million dollars, which at the time was the highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. At the time of sale the art world was typified by a conservative climate, and the high purchase price, as well as the painting itself, created a political and media scandal, which was capitalized upon by the National Gallery of Australia, who bought the painting. It is now one of the most popular exhibits at the Gallery, and has risen in price to an estimated $180 million."
Crucifixion with a Donor,Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"Bosch is known for his works peopled with demonic beings, revealing an exceptional independence from the pictorial tradition of his time. However,the Crucifixion with a Donor, which is attributed to him, is perfectly in line with the iconographic tradition of the 15th century.

The composition shows a sort of hierarchical intercession procedure. The kneeling donor is praying for his salvation. He is accompanied by his patron, St Peter, identified by the key in his hand. Turning towards St John the Evangelist, St Peter presents his protégé. St John then looks towards the Virgin, asking her to intercede with her Son, which she does by praying. Christ figures on the cross as a sign of redemption, his sacrifice having made possible the salvation of the human race. The scene is portrayed in the place reserved for the torture of condemned criminals, on the edge of a Brabant city which is visible in the distance. Midway, a broken gibbet lies on the ground, surrounded by scattered bones and crows. Some figures are walking along the paths leading towards a mill to the left and a castle to the right.

The donor's identity is not known. Only his first name, Peter, is indicated by the presence of his patron saint. He is dressed in a white shirt and a brown pourpoint. Over this he wears a black cape and a hat on his head. His legs are dressed in striped black and red breeches and stockings decorated with the same motif. A sword shows out from under the cape. This costume, which was worn in the Low Countries during the last 20 years of the 15th century, could indicate that the donor was in a lord's service.

We do not know whether this panel originally had wings. No other crucifixion by Hieronymus Bosch is known, although the theme returns as a secondary motif in others of his paintings. It is also one of the master's few works containing a donor portrait. The style displays a striking balance and serenity. The flesh colours of Christ's body are softened and the draperies sober. The countryside shows a very gentle gradation of greens, producing a successful effect of depth.

The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things (tabletop),Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"Unlike many of his works, in which Bosch used intricate levels of symbolism to represent his meaning, The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things literally represents the levels of sin, the punishments, and the eye of God watching over everything. Interestingly, even at his most literal, Bosch is still able to include a vast amount of symbolism into his descriptions of each of the seven deadly sins. Those sent to hell for the sin of greed are boiled in pots of gold, and in the sin of pride a demon holds a mirror up to a prideful woman. The series of paintings is much more than a description of each sin and its punishment, as a whole it represents a warning to those who would engage in sin, and acts as a deterrent to evil doing."
Haywain,Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"Although similar to the Garden of Earthly Delights triptych, the Haywain Triptych is a less fantastical and nightmarish depiction of the same tale. From the left to the right, the panels depict God creating Eve from one of Adam’s ribs, earthly humans engaging in all types of sins, and a portrayal of the journey into hell. This journey through good and evil is a much less terrifying tale, as it details the many sins of humans, yet does not detail the frightfully lurid and shocking horrors under the watchful eye of the prince of hell. The outer panels of the triptych, when closed, detail a character called the wayfarer, who makes his way through the panels and through the journey from good to evil, allowing the viewer to place himself inside the world of the triptych, and take the journey along with him."
The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things (detail),Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,“Glory” or Heaven.
Temptation of St. Anthony (detail),Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"This triptych series detail the supernatural temptation of Saint Anthony during his stay in Egypt, a theme which has also been treated by many other artists, including Martin Schongauer, Mathias Gruenewald, Salvador Dali, and Gustave Flaubert. The symbolism in the paintings symbolizes the story, which depicts Anthony refraining from many different types of sin throughout the series. The fantastical images are typical of Bosch’s nightmarish style, complete with imps, monsters, and dysmorphic creatures. This triptych is often considered to be one of Bosch’s greatest work, and at least three copies have been reproduced, all of which are imitations of the original; one of which was thought to be the actual original."
The Garden of Earthly Delights,Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"By far the best known and most ambitious work, The Garden of Earthly Delights illustrates Bosch’s individual artistic style, containing the most vivid imagery and complexity of symbolic meaning. The triptych is generally thought to be a warning of the dangers of giving in to temptation, but has been subject to vast amounts of conjecture and scrutiny, and critics and historians are split in two directions. Whereas some believe that the middle panel, which depicts a fantastical world of nudes in sexual engagement, large fruits, and other suggestive elements, is simply an illustration of paradise lost, others believe that it is a moral warning, which will lead you to hell, as it is depicted in the third panel of the series. Although there are many contradictory explanations, it is generally thought to be a warning against lust, one of the seven deadly sins."
The Stone Operation / The Extraction of the Stone Madness / The Cure of Folly,Bosch Hieronymus,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"Bosch’s symbolic genius is hard at work in this painting. It used to be thought that a stone was the cause of madness, and if removed, it would cure the individual of insanity or folly. The stone was removed through trepidation, or drilling a whole into an individual’s skull and literally removing the “stone.” Bosch’s play on the imagery in the painting is beyond literal. The person performing the procedure is wearing a funnel hat, which at the time meant he was a charlatan, and the woman wears a book on her head, which also suggests folly. Combined, the images are a satire on madness and folly, as they depict a ridiculous scene, filled with symbolism of the nonsensical."
Concert Champetre,Titian,High Renaissance,allegorical painting,"This work is one of the mysteries of European painting: in spite of its undeniable quality and epochal importance, opinions are divergent concerning both its creator and its theme. It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.

The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of ""Pastorale"" and only subsequently was it given the title ""Fête champêtre"" or ""Concert champêtre"", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.

The female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's ""Poetica"".

The scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music."
Madonna and Child with Sts Anthony of Padua and Roch,Titian,High Renaissance,religious painting,"One of Titian's earliest religious paintings, the Madonna and Child with Sts Anthony of Padua and Roch was until fairly recently attributed to Giorgione, and the Virgin with her delicate, oval face and crisp folds of red drapery denned by shadow descends from the more remote and queenly Virgin of Giorgione's only altarpiece, the Castelfranco Madonna."
Sacred and Profane Love,Titian,High Renaissance,allegorical painting,"Two women, apparently drawn from the same model, are posed in a bucolic landscape by a trough, while its water is stirred by a winged Eros. The painting is rich in symbolism and iconography, although there is a lack of consensus amongst critics about its meaning. Even the title of the painting may not be original, as it was not recorded until 1693. The composition of the picture contains elements found in the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], whose style had a significant influence on Titian at the beginning of his career.

The woman to the left is dressed in wedding attire and may represent carnal love and beauty. In contrast, the nude is usually read as spiritual love, a symbol of simplicity and purity. The position of Eros, at the center of the two, therefore, may indicate the point of mediation between spiritual and sexual desires.

The coat of arms on the trough belongs to the family of Niccolò Aurelio, who later became Grand Chancellor of Venice. In May of 1514, he married Laura Bagarotto, daughter of the jurist Bertuccio Bagarotto who had been executed some months before the wedding on charges of betraying the Serenissima Republic. The painting was probably commissioned to celebrate the marriage. It has been suggested that the relief design on the front of the trough symbolizes life and death, inviting the newlywed Laura, to overcome the sorrow for the loss of her father and flourish in marital love, both spiritual and physical. Alternative readings for this design include symbolism for the taming of passions or hidden literary references."
Portrait of a Venetian Gentleman,Titian,High Renaissance,portrait,"The museum attributes it to [url href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Cariani]Giovanni Cariani (c. 1490-1547)[/url]

The expression of calculating, almost cruel, appraisal—amplified by his closed fist—gives this man an aggressive air, but we do not know his identity. The inscription on the parapet does not help. These letters, VVO, have been interpreted as a form of the Latin vivo (in life). This would suggest that the portrait was painted from life and that it confers on both subject and painter a measure of immortality. It may more likely, however, be an abbreviation of a humanist motto, perhaps virtus vincit omnia (virtue conquers all).

Like other paintings associated with Giorgione, this one presents difficulties of attribution. Both Titian and Sebastiano are know to have completed works that remained unfinished when Giorgione died prematurely in his early thirties. (It was said that Giorgione contracted the plague from his mistress.) A second hand seems to be at work in this painting. The portrait's format, with subject glancing sidelong at the viewer from behind a parapet, was developed by Giorgione, and the soft, shadowy gradations of tone also recall his style. However, its aggressive mood points to a painter with a bolder brush and more active, worldly outlook, like Titian."
Assumption of the Virgin,Titian,High Renaissance,religious painting,"This altarpiece by Titian, one of the most inspirational works of Christian art, is undoubtedly among the greatest Renaissance paintings of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/venetian-school]Venetian School[/url]. The most substantial work of its type in Venice (nearly seven meters high), it was Titian's first major commissioned work in the city and took him two years to paint. It hangs over the high altar in the Franciscan Basilica of S. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in  Venice, where its color and colossal size ensures that it can be seen from the other end of the church. 

When it was unveiled in May 1518, it instantly established the young artist as the pre-eminent figure of Venetian art. And it wasn't just its colossal size; it was a revolutionary composition. While earlier religious paintings inside churches (like Giorgione's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/madonna-and-child-with-saints-liberale-and-francis-the-castelfranco-madonna-1505][i]The Castelfranco Madonna[/i][/url], 1505) had been relatively static, with statue-like saints and regal Madonnas, Titian's figures are bursting with energy and life, thus giving the work enormous emotional power and drama. Its effect on the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]High Renaissance[/url] painting was immediate. When first unveiled, Titian's [i]cinquecento[/i] contemporaries were immediately struck by the upward-striving dynamics, the dramatic expressiveness of the scene, and the agitation of the figures. It is perhaps no coincidence that, within 12 months, the mid-air quality and upward motion of the painting were emulated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-transfiguration-1520][i]Transfiguration[/i][/url] (c.1518-1520). 

Titian divided this exquisite work of Biblical art into three sections. The lowest register represents the terrestrial plane where the disciples witness the assumption; in the middle section, the Virgin Mary soars upward, surrounded by a swarm of angelic cherubim, towards the top part representing Heaven, where God awaits her. The star of the painting is, of course, the Madonna, who is shown as being elevated upwards in a whirl of drapery on solid-looking clouds. Illustrating an essential event in Roman Catholicism - the moment when Mary is assumed into Heaven - it is the most famous Assumption in Renaissance art, if not all Western art. One gets the feeling that she is not just a symbol of salvation but perhaps a symbol of Venice, too. Above the Virgin, the heavenly zone is suffused with golden light (allegedly in homage to the tradition of Venetian mosaic art). At the same time, below her set in shadowy earth, the apostles (Saint Peter, Saint Thomas, and Saint Andrew) are stunned by the miraculous happening but also distraught at losing the mother of Christ, their savior. They implore her to stay, but her gaze is already directed towards Heaven. There, she is awaited by God,  who looks with a stern yet sad face on his children below.

Nowadays, Titian is most famous for his vibrant, sensual use of color and his radical technique of painting. Brush loads of color pigments appear to float across the canvas. His virtuoso handling of color is evident in the [i]Assumption[/i]: see how the two disciples in the red form a pyramid with the Madonna, drawing our eyes up to the red robe of God. Not long after finishing the [i]Assumption[/i], Titian painted a second large altarpiece in the Frari, known as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/pesaros-madonna-1526][i]The Madonna of the Pesaro Family[/i][/url] (1519-1526), that is an even better showcase of his exquisite rendering of the luxurious silks and velvets for which Venice was famous. And by moving the image of the Virgin and Child off-center, it again demonstrated the young artist's restless innovation. 

In the [i]Assumption[/i], Titian used light and shadow to present the apostles as a mass of bodies rather than highlighting their individuality. This demonstrates the artist's awareness of developments in High Renaissance painting in Florence and Rome and his incorporation of these new ideas into his work. Titian also broke with tradition by omitting all details of the landscape in which the image is situated to focus on the events and emotions of the piece, although the sky above the apostles' heads suggests the setting is outside. The [i]Assumption[/i] takes added inspiration from several sources outside Venice. Compositionally, it shares certain iconographical features with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/the-sistine-madonna-1513][i]Sistine Madonna[/i][/url] (1513) and other works of Raphael, while the vigorous figures of the disciples echo those in Michelangelo's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sistine-chapel-ceiling-god-dividing-land-and-water-1512]Genesis fresco in the Sistine Chapel[/url]. In any event, the painting seems to indicate a clear desire on Titian's part to escape the confines of Venetian painting in order to establish his own universal style of religious art: a style which incorporates power and drama as well as the traditional Venetian appreciation of decorative art and clearly alludes to the coming of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/mannerism-late-renaissance]Mannerism[/url]. The brilliant Venetian neoclassical sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonio-canova]Antonio Canova[/url] described this work as the most beautiful painting in the world. In 1818, it was removed from the altar and transferred to the Venice Academy of Fine Art, where it remained for a century before being returned to the Frari in 1919."
Bacchus and Ariadne,Titian,High Renaissance,mythological painting,"This colorful history painting (also known as a [i]poesie[/i]) is one of a cycle of mythological pictures based on classical texts which were commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for his [i]Camerino d'Alabastro[/i] – a private chamber in his ducal palace in Ferrara. This work - a substitute for one by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] - was one of three provided by Titian between 1518 and 1525. The other two are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518][i]Worship of Venus[/i][/url] (1518-1519) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchanal-1524][i]Bacchanal of the Andrians[/i][/url] (1523-1525), both now in the Prado Museum, Madrid.

Derived from stories by the Roman poets Ovid and Catullus, this picture portrays the first encounter between Bacchus (god of wine), and Ariadne (daughter of King Minos), on the island of Naxos. Despite her vital role in helping Theseus to defeat the minotaur, Ariadne has been deserted by her lover, whose ship can be seen (far left of the picture) sailing away into the distance. As she watches the ship depart, her sorrow is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of Bacchus and his unruly troupe of drunken friends, one of whom (a satyr) is waving aloft the head of an animal they have just killed (its head is lying on the ground). When the startled Ariadne turns to face the revelers, she sees Bacchus leaping from his chariot and their eyes meet: it is love at first sight. Bacchus leaps down from his chariot, drawn by two cheetahs, and declares his love. He promises to be a more faithful partner than Theseus and offers her a constellation of stars (Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown) as a wedding gift. Other versions have Bacchus raising her to heaven and transforming her into a constellation, represented by the eight stars above her.

Titian manages to extract the maximum amount of drama out of the story, mainly through the dynamic postures adopted by his two main actors. But equally important are their swirling draperies with their luminous blue and rose tones - Titian's two favorite colors. At any rate, the composition is filled with movement and color, as semi-naked figures writhe and cavort in poses taken from Greek sculpture of classical antiquity, such as the satyr who is struggling with snakes in a similar fashion to that shown in the Greek statue [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-greek-painting/laocoon-and-his-sons--125][i]Laocoon and His Sons[/i][/url] (c.125 BC). A diagonal dividing line separates the golds and greens of the landscape scene from the broad area of ultramarine blue (obtained by grinding the most expensive of all color pigments - the Afghanistan-mined lapis lazuli)."
The Bacchanal of the Andrians,Titian,High Renaissance,mythological painting,"This colorful figure painting is one of a series of Roman mythological works commissioned by Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for his palace at Ferrara. It was part of a group of three painted by Titian between 1518 and 1525. The other two are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/the-worship-of-venus-1518][i]Worship of Venus[/i][/url] (1518-1519) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/bacchus-and-ariadne-1523][i]Bacchus and Ariadne[/i][/url] (1520-1523). It stemmed from the Roman writer Philostratus, who left a collection of descriptions of pictures under the title ""Imagines."" One concerned the visit of Bacchus and his entourage of satyrs and bacchantes to the island of Andros. There, the natives were blessed by the presence of a river of wine. Upon the suggestion of his patron, Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, who wanted works to decorate his private [i]studiolo[/i], Titian reconstructed the classical narrative in this masterpiece.

The scene is set on the island of Andros, where the followers of Bacchus await his arrival in varying stages of inebriation, as they drink from the island's river of wine. Bacchus himself is not present, but his ship can be seen in the distance. Meantime, gods, men, and children celebrate the sublime effects of wine, whose consumption, according to Philostratus, makes men dominant, rich, generous to their friends, handsome and tall beyond their dreams. If Philostratus' description was sparse, this painting is riotously full of detail and incident, and only Titian could create, at the center of the scene, the brilliant and unforgettable emblem of this Bacchic setting. Silhouetted against the sky, a dancing youth holds a glass wine jug. He looks up, like an astronomer, at this sun and moon of his inebriated universe. A debate about balance and the horizontal is conducted by the clear vessel, tilted, and the equator of wine that it contains. Beneath such a heavenly body, the earth will be drunk and inspiring too.

With the coming of dawn on Andros, the river god, instead of adopting his canonical reclining position, remains a lie-a-bed in his mulch of vines (top-right). The wine-red stream has also left the nymph in the foreground - based on a classical statue of Ariadne - to her erotic slumbers, as undisturbed by the singing, dancing, and drinking that continue among the elaborately interwoven throng as by Apollo's call. Titian also deviated from the original text by creating two immigrants to Andros. They are the two courtly young women reclining in the center foreground amid a litter of overturned vessels of various sorts, indicating abandon. The girl in red has had her attentions to the nude youth (deriving from a figure in Michelangelo's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo/sketch-of-a-nude-man-study-for-the-battle-of-cascina][i]Battle of Cascina[/i][/url]) interrupted by her companion. In contrast, he has been distracted by the dancer in ochre. Now, in close conversation, the girls do not engage directly with those about them as, with lingering gestures, they lay aside the shepherds' pipes, which, in more than one sense, they have been playing. Their tune, on the paper, is now taken up by the singers standing among the trees behind them. These music-makers are to be distinguished from the Andrians - fellow mortals - and from the spirits and deities that occupy the place. It may be understood that the immortals, and indeed the Andrians themselves, have been conjured up in the imagination by the girls, or else that - sensitive to the spirit of the scene and the effects of wine - they are rewarded by the attentions of beings who await the call of mortals' music and imagination.

Other figures also allude to classical statuary. The maenad (female follower of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine) dressed in white, is a reference to the sculpture of an antique torso in the Grimani collection, while the male nude pouring wine on the left appears to be a reworking of The Wounded Gaul, a work of Hellenistic art unearthed in Rome around 1515 and probably known to Titian through a drawing.

Titian called this type of picture a [i]poesie[/i]. It is the creation of the artist, and it addresses its audience as does a poem, allusively - inviting a meditation, a reverie, an engagement of sensibility, and never arriving at a definitive meaning."
The Feast of the Gods,Titian,High Renaissance,mythological painting,"The Feast of the Gods is an oil painting by Giovanni Bellini, with substantial additions by Titian, who added all the landscape to the left and centre. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for his camerino d'alabastro ('chamber of alabaster') in the Castello Estense, Ferrara. It is one of the few mythological pictures by Bellini, who completed it in 1514. After his death soon afterwards (1516), Titian probably modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518–1523), also in Alfonso's camerino. A more thorough reworking in about 1529 added more landscape, adding the mountain behind the figures.

The scene depicted conflates two episodes in Ovid's Fasti. Priapus, on the right, is attempting to seduce the sleeping nymph Lotis, but is prevented from success by the bray of Silenus' donkey. Around are the drunken Gods: Jupiter has an eagle next to him, Poseidon is caressing Cybele and Ceres, while Hermes is languidly lying on a barrel. The boy with vine-leaves on his head is an unusually young depiction of Bacchus. It is thought that Bellini initially painted the figures as mortals, following a misleading translation of Ovid (the so-called Ovidio volgarizzato), and had to re-paint them with the attributes of the Olympian gods."
Venus of Urbino,Titian,High Renaissance,mythological painting,"One of the greatest Renaissance paintings of a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/mythological-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]mythological[/url] nature, the life-size [i]Venus of Urbino[/i] remains the iconic version of the reclining female nude, and a treasure of the Venetian [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]High Renaissance[/url]. The picture was based on the earlier work [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione/the-sleeping-venus-1510][i]The Sleeping Venus[/i][/url] (1510) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgione]Giorgione[/url], a close friend of the artist, although Titian's interpretation of the goddess is much more erotic. This sensuality is heightened by the directness of the nude's gaze, her faint smile, and her awareness of the viewer, along with the depiction of her in an opulent domestic environment without the allegorical or mythological symbols traditionally associated with Venus. While Giorgione's nude is idealized and demure, Titian's is realistic and tempting. The warm, light tones of her skin are in contrast to the darker, more affluent background, and the play of light on her body and subtle use of [i]chiaroscuro[/i] gives a sculptural quality to the nude. Her curves also contrast with the regularity of architectural elements, including the tiled floor, classical column, and green hanging, which bisects the scene, highlighting the fertile center of the figure.

Titian's exceptional talent, his bold depiction of female sensuality, and his status as the leading Venetian painter of the Cinquecento is why this picture is often cited as the origin of many of Western art's most controversial images - including, for instance, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya/nude-maja-1800][i]The Nude Maja[/i][/url] (c.1797) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya]Goya[/url], as well as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/olympia-1863][i]Olympia[/i][/url] (1863) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet]Edouard Manet[/url] - and is considered to be the original precursor to the pin-up.

Titian painted this picture for the Duke of Camerino Guidobaldo della Rovere, who later became the Duke of Urbino, possibly to celebrate his marriage to Giuliana Varano. Despite her erotic air, Titian's Venus is no courtesan, and the painting is not a subtle promotion of casual infidelity. On the contrary, given that it was painted to commemorate Guidobaldo's marriage, it is almost certainly celebrating marital love and the physical intimacy between man and wife, a supposition supported by a number of details. In her right hand, for instance, the girl holds a posy of roses, which usually symbolize love; also, the sleeping dog is a common symbol of fidelity; lastly, the maids in the background are depicted rummaging in a traditional [i]cassone[/i], where wives commonly stored their [i]trousseaux[/i]. Perhaps the picture was conceived as an ideal model of behavior for Giuliana, the Duke's young bride. It was certainly not uncommon for pictures of an explicitly erotic nature to be commissioned to celebrate a wedding, although they would be intended for private viewing only.

[i]The Venus of Urbino[/i] is full of artistic devices. To begin with, Titian achieves a beautiful contrast between the voluptuous curves of the girl's body and the vertical and horizontal lines of the dividing screen, floor tiles, and other architectural elements. The play of light on the girl's body and Titian's delicate [i]chiaroscuro[/i] lends a sculptural quality to her figure and also enhances the silky drapery of the bedsheets. The floor tiles provide an extra linear perspective, while the floral patterns of the couch, [i]cassoni[/i], and background tapestry - in conjunction with the rich color pigments of the screen and the maid's costume - help to unify and activate the composition.

By the time he executed this work, Titian was established as the leading master of Renaissance art in Venice. Above all, he was known for his remarkable use of color, and his works - which spanned all the major genres, including church altarpieces, mythological painting, portrait art, and pastoral landscape - were increasingly sought after by members of Italian Royal Houses. He went on to become recognized as a genius in his own time and has since been revered by such Old Masters as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Van Dyck[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Poussin[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/peter-paul-rubens]Rubens[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url]. In many subjects and painting genres, he set patterns that were copied by generations of painters, especially in portraiture. Unfortunately, his talent as an artist was not matched by his generosity of spirit: he became notorious for his greed and miserliness."
"Portrait of Pope Paul III, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Duke Ottavio Farnese",Titian,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),portrait,"This work by Titian, one of the most famous Renaissance portraits, languished in the Farnese family cellars in Rome for more than a century before it was hung on a wall. Now it can be seen in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples, as is regarded by scholars as a perfect example of [i]cinquecento[/i] portrait art - a masterpiece of characterization, body language, and color. Commissioned by the Farnese family in 1546, like many papal portraits it was intended as a public statement of Farnese power. In the work, the 77-year old Pope Paul III is shown seated, accompanied by his Grandsons, the Cardinals Alessandro and Ottavio Farnese. Aside from the coloristic magic that Titian creates with his rich, warm color palette, the work perfectly complements the earlier group portrait by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url] - [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portraits-of-leo-x-cardinal-luigi-de-rossi-and-giulio-de-medici-1518][i]Pope Leo X with Cardinals[/i][/url] (1518) - which is another masterful representation of Papal power and character. 

In the 16th century, in order to avoid being steamrollered on political and religious issues by Spain or France, the head of the Catholic Church needed money, military resources and a cunning, resourceful mind. In this wonderful example of Venetian portrait painting, Titian represents his subject accordingly. It was well known that Pope Paul III applied few if any religious rules to his own conduct. To him, and to many of his predecessors, a religious career was merely an opportunity for self-enrichment. He had his own concubine, with whom he had fathered four children; he made both his grandsons Cardinals, and he amassed a huge personal fortune from church taxes and other benefits. With Emperor Charles V, King of Spain, angling for both financial support (against rebellious Protestants in the Low Countries) and reform of the Catholic Church, and the King of France at loggerheads with Charles, Pope Paul had to tread a devious path between the two monarchs. Titian thus presents him as a man whose body is turned one way, but whose head faces another. His face is shrunken, his beard is unkempt, yet he seems full of dynamic energy - almost as if he is ready to pounce. His eyes are bright and twinkling, but they possess a sort of peasant watchfulness. In short: a wealthy, slightly devious old man.

Alessandro and Ottavio are the two eldest sons of Paul's son Pier Luigi. They symbolize the continuity of the Farnese Papal line. Raphael's Medici Family Pope, Leo X, had in time been succeeded by his nephew Cardinal Giulio de'Medici as Pope Clement VII, so Paul naturally wanted a successor of his own. Of course Cardinal Alessandro was no more religious than his grandfather. In fact, apart from several mistresses, he diverted huge sums from the Church into his collection of rare antiquities and Renaissance art at the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. X-rays of the canvas show that he was originally positioned further to the left. In all likelihood, he convinced Titian to move him closer to the Pope - even to the extent of grasping the top of Paul's chair with his right hand - as a sign of his claim to the Papacy. The ambivalent expression that Titian gives him is no more than he deserves. Not least because it was Alessandro who invited Titian to Rome with the promise of living for his son, in place of a fee. In the end, Titian's son was paid off with a small parish worth a fraction of the original offer - an insulting reward for his father's time and effort.

Paul's younger son, the 21-year old Ottavio (married to a daughter of Charles V), is shown leaning towards the Pope, about to bow and kiss the papal foot as prescribed. The body language is unmistakable - here is a person who is not 'upright'! Moreover, his serious face alludes to a major dispute between himself and his grandfather over the Duchy of Parma, which initially had been promised to him, but was now going to a relative of the King of France.

The Pope's hand, strictly speaking, should be visible on the far side of the table. But for reasons that remain unclear, Titian did not paint it. Other areas of the painting were also left unfinished. After detailed study, the Italian art historian Roberto Zapperi has concluded that the most likely explanation was the shift in papal political allegiances (away from Spain, towards France) that took place as the picture was being completed. Being an expensive-looking large format work, as well as something of a political statement, the painting was deemed to be no longer appropriate in the new political climate and was therefore consigned to the darkness of the Farnese cellars. 

Titian was the first painter for whom color in painting was more important than any other aesthetic or painterly element. Not only are there very few examples of drawing by him, but also he uses color to establish the setting, create atmosphere, and represent all the varying reflections of his subjects situations and personalities. In his oil painting, visible brush strokes and strongly textured surfaces replace the ""smooth finish"" required by the traditions of the High Renaissance. (Michelangelo, for instance, criticized the lack of [i]disegno[/i] in Titian's work, and its subordination to [i]colorito[/i], but complimented the Venetian's coloring.) Titian became the acknowledged leader of Renaissance art in Venice, forming in the process a notoriously self-serving 'triumvirate', along with the sculptor/architect Jacopo Sansovino and the scurrilous writer Pietro Aretino, who became his publicity agent."
Landscape with Christ Appearing to the Apostles at the Sea of Tiberias,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"religious painting, landscape","In 1551 or 1552 Bruegel set off on the customary northern artist’s journey to Italy, probably by way of France. From several extant paintings, drawings, and etchings, it can be deduced that he traveled beyond Naples to Sicily, possibly as far as Palermo, and that in 1553 he lived for some time in Rome, where he worked with a celebrated miniaturist, [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giulio-clovio]Giulio Clovio[/url], an artist greatly influenced by [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url] and later a patron of the young [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco]El Greco[/url]. The inventory of Clovio’s estate shows that he owned a number of paintings and drawings by Bruegel as well as a miniature done by the two artists in collaboration. It was in Rome in 1553 that Bruegel produced his earliest signed and dated painting, 'Landscape with Christ and the Apostles at the Sea of Tiberias'. The holy figures in this painting were probably done by [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maarten-de-vos]Maarten de Vos[/url], a painter from Antwerp then working in Italy."

The Ass in the School,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,allegorical painting,"The population of the Netherlands provinces had a high level of education - indeed, an Italian traveller even ventured the opinion that everyone could read and write. Bruegel is laughing at his countrymen's eagerness to learn: the caption comments that ""An ass will never become a horse, even if he goes to school."""
View of Tivoli,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,landscape,"Engraved by Joannes van Doetecum (Netherlandish, active 1554–about 1600), and Lucas van Doetecum (Netherlandish, active 1554–about 1584), After Pieter Bruegel, the Elder, published by Hieronymus Cock (Netherlandish, 1510–1570)"
Parable of the Sower,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"This painting of the parable of the sower from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke is among the earliest signed paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Bruegel left Antwerp in 1553 to study in Italy, and on his return made drawings of the Alps, which influenced the detail and aerial perspective of the landscape in this painting."
"Ice Skating before the Gate of Saint George, Antwerp",Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"Engraved by Frans Huys (Netherlandish, 1522–1562), after Pieter Bruegel, the Elder, published by Hieronymus Cock (Netherlandish, 1510–1570)"
The Fight between Carnival and Lent,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,allegorical painting,"The Fight between Carnival and Lent depicts a common festival held in the Southern Netherlands. On the left side of the painting there is an inn, and in the right side of the painting there is a church. The juxtaposition is meant to illustrate the two sides of human nature: pleasure and religious chastity, and the contrast between the two. Near the church sit well-behaved children. Near the inn are rambunctious drunkards. The fat man in the middle of the painting, with the pie on his head, is a representation of “carnival.” The painting represents a common theme in 16th century Europe, the battle between Carnival and Lent, and with its humor and witticism, is a satirical critique on the conflicts of the Reformation."
Netherlandish Proverbs,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,allegorical painting,"Also entitled The Blue Cloak or The Topsy Turvy World, this painting contains a literal illustration of idioms and aphorisms of 16th century Flemish life. Whereas some of the idioms have been lost to history, others are still relevant and in use today. Although other artists and authors had produced paintings and books on proverbs, this painting is considered to be the first large-scale rendition of the theme. The proverbs, of which there are over 100, as well as the early titles, are meant to illustrate human stupidity and foolishness. The painting was so popular that Pieter Brueghel the Younger reproduced up to twenty copies of it, many of which included various renditions on the proverbs."
Landscape with the Fall of Icarus,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,mythological painting,"The painting is probably a version of a lost original by Bruegel, probably from the 1560s or soon after. It is in oils whereas Bruegel's other paintings on canvas are in tempera.

Though the world landscape, a type of work with the title subject represented by small figures in the distance, was an established type in Early Netherlandish painting, pioneered by Joachim Patiner, to have a much larger unrelated ""genre"" figure in the foreground is original and represents something of a blow against the emerging hierarchy of genres. Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example The Hunters in the Snow (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a ""higher"" class of painting in the background."
Children's Games,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"The artist's intention for this work is more serious than simply to compile an illustrated encyclopaedia of children's games, though some eighty particular games have been identified.See details below Bruegel shows the children absorbed in their games with the seriousness displayed by adults in their apparently more important pursuits. His moral is that in the mind of God children's games possess as much significance as the activities of their parents. This idea was a familiar one in contemporary literature: in an anonymous Flemish poem published in Antwerp in 1530 by Jan van Doesborch, mankind is compared to children who are entirely absorbed in their foolish games and concerns."
The Hare Hunt,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"Bruegel made many landscape drawings during his journey to Italy between 1552 and 1555. In Antwerp the workshop of Hieronymus Cock published large prints after these drawings. The young brothers Lucas and Baptista van Doetecum , assistants in Cock's studio, were responsible for translating the drawings into prints. Only once did Bruegel taken up the etching needle himself, for this Hare Hunt."
The Fair on St. George's Day,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"Printed by Johannes of Lucas van Doetechum after Pieter Bruegel the Elder, published by Hieronymus Cock."
Two Monkeys,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,animal painting,"Bruegel's Two Monkeys is seen as a “small allegory” in which the monkeys represent foolish sinners, and their imprisonment is the result of an immoderate attitude towards material wealth. The monkey on the left signifies avarice; the monkey on the right, prodigality, a conclusion based on an analysis of Bruegel's unusual composition (with its polarized and contrasted figures), a comparison with other 16th-century compositions depicting monkeys, and the observation that the Two Monkeys has a fundamental resemblance to another Bruegel painting, the Dulle Griet (Mad Meg). The similarity between these two works and the contextual evidence (the art, literature, and pageantry of the period) support the view that Bruegel's subject was the improper use of wealth — a central issue for humanist Christians in the Low Countries in the 1560's."
The Fall of the Rebel Angels,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"'The Fall of the Rebel Angels' reveals the artist's profound debt to Hieronymous Bosch, especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. Together with 'Dulle Griet' and 'The Triumph of Death', which have similar dimensions, it was probably painted for the same collector and destined to become part of a series."
The Suicide of Saul,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"Saul's death was interpreted as a punishment of pride - it was among the proud that Dante met Saul in the Purgatorio - and this may account for Bruegel's choice of such an unusual subject. As with most of his subjects taken from the Bible, Bruegel treats Saul's suicide as a contemporary event, showing the armies in 16th century armour.

The Suicide of Saul is an early attempt by Bruegel to reconcile landscape and figure painting. If it is compared with one of his latest works, The Magpie on the Gallows of 1568, its weaknesses are apparent: the foreground and background are not yet reconciled and the jutting outcrop of rock in the centresee 2nd detail is a mannerist device which one may see again in The Procession to Calvary. However, the distant landscape is seen through a shimmering haze, which seems to have the effect of emphasizing the foreground detail, and this does represent a new stage in the evolution of Bruegel's depiction of naturalistic landscape."
The Tower of Babel,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"religious painting, cityscape","The Tower of Babel is the subject of three oil paintings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The first, a miniature painted on ivory, was painted while Bruegel was in Rome and is now lost. The Tower of Babel is on display at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Another painting of the same subject [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-little-tower-of-babel-1563]The ""Little"" Tower of Babel[/url], c. 1563, is in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam.

Bruegel's depiction of the architecture of the tower, with its numerous arches and other examples of Roman engineering, is deliberately reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum, which Christians of the time saw as both a symbol of hubris and persecution."
Yawning Man (disputed attribution),Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"portrait, sketch and study","This little tondo was long attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, but experts have more recently agreed that it was painted by the hand of his eldest son. 
It is a study of a face aimed at analysing extreme facial expressions. In Renaissance theory of art, the correct rendering of facial expressions was an important artistic requirement. Before this, Bruegel experts tried to interpret the yawning face as an allegory for Sloth. This sin was generally considered as “the Devil’s pillow”. The sort of work ethic which is portrayed by this expression was far from a foreign concept for the pre-capitalist middle-class society of the 16th century. Art from this time uses satirical images of beggars and other types of people who did not earn their money from working. 
The fact that a country man is depicted yawning is doubtless not by chance: the urban middle classes wished to set themselves apart from this vulgar behaviour practiced by peasants and country folk. Yawning, and particularly showing ones teeth whilst doing so was considered as rude."
The Triumph of Death,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"This painting depicts a customary theme in medieval literature: the dance of Death, which was frequently used by Northern artists. Brueghel casts the entire work in a reddish-brown tone that gives the scene an infernal aspect appropriate for the subject at hand. The profusion of scenes and moralizing sense applied by the artists are part of Hieronymous Bosch´s influence on this work. Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death and the Italian conception of the Triumph of Death, as in frescoes he would have seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa."
Landscape with the Flight into Egypt,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"landscape, religious painting","The story of the Holy Family fleeing persecution in Bethlehem is transposed to an imaginary Northern European landscape, above a river valley bordered by craggy peaks. The dramatic setting enhances the religious narrative. The idol tumbling from its shrine in a pollarded willow (to the right of Mary) symbolises the defeat of paganism at the birth of Christ. Bruegel painted this for a major patron, Cardinal Perronot de Granvelle. It was later owned by the artist Peter Paul Rubens."
Portrait of an Old Woman,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"portrait, sketch and study","This is probably a study for a major painting. Bruegel painted no commissioned portraits, nor any of prominent contemporaries. He was uninterested in any cult of personality. However, this portrait of a peasant woman reveals just how capable he was of portraying faces with highly individual features."
The Procession to Calvary,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"This is the second-largest known painting by Bruegel (after [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/the-wine-of-saint-martin-s-day-1568]The Wine of Saint Martin's Day[/url]). For Bruegel the composition is unusually traditional. Perhaps because he was treating such a solemn religious event, he adopted a well-known scheme. Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them."
Dulle Griet (Mad Meg),Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"Dulle Griet, also known as Mad Meg, is a figure of Flemish folklore - a virago, who leads an army of women to pillage Hell. Griet was a disparaging name given to any bad-tempered, shrewish woman. Her mission refers to the Flemish proverb:'She could plunder in front of hell and return unscathed'.
Bruegel is thus making fun of noisy, aggressive women. At the same time he castigates the sin of covetousness: although already burdened down with possessions, Griet and her grotesque companions are prepared to storm the mouth of Hell itself in their search for more"
The Adoration of the Kings,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"In this unusual rendering of the Adoration, the Three Kings presenting their gifts are treated as caricatures and the Virgin is not idealised. The work is composed from a high viewpoint, focusing attention on the Infant Christ on his mother's lap, at the exact centre of the picture. People crowd around them and there is little sense of depth or space. The elongated figures of the Kings are characteristic of a painting style that was fashionable around this time.

A figure on the extreme right wears spectacles. His presence may indicate that those around Christ are blind to his significance; Bruegel has used spectacles on other occasions to signify in an ironic manner the inability of the subject to see the truth. Most of the figures, in fact, appear to be gently mocked by the artist.

It is uncommon for soldiers to be included in a depiction of the Adoration. As in other works by Bruegel, their presence may reflect the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands at this time."
The Death of the Virgin,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"This grisaille panel was painted  for Abraham Ortelius, the great Antwerp geographer, who was a close friend of Bruegel. Later it belonged to Rubens.

Bruegel's interpretation of the scene is unusual in the exceptionally large numbers of the just who crowd around the Virgin's deathbed. The literary source for this is Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend, which tells of numerous holy persons being present when Mary was reunited with her son.

John the disciple, sleeping next to the fireplace on the left of the picture, is dreaming that the apostles and other saints have assembled around the bed of the dying Virgin. Bruegel is employing seemingly supernatural lighting effects here, such as would later be typical of Rembrandt's work."
The Gloomy Day (January),Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,landscape,"The painting is one in a series of six works, five of which are still extant, that depict different times of the year."
The Harvesters (July–August),Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"genre painting, landscape","The Harvesters is one of five surviving paintings from a probable group of six, a series commissioned from Bruegel by the wealthy Antwerp merchant Niclaes Jongelinck, apparently as an extensive decorative scheme for the dining room of his suburban home, Ter Beken. The four other paintings of the group are the Gloomy Day, Hunters in the Snow, and the Return of the Herd (all Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), and Haymaking (Lobkowicz Collections, Prague). 
 Although ""16 pieces"" by the artist are listed in Jongelinck's 1566 inventory, only two independent works and the Twelff maenden (twelve months) are mentioned by name, suggesting that the series may originally have included twelve paintings. By 1595, however, when the panels were purchased by the city of Antwerp and presented as a gift to Archduke Ernst, they are described as six paintings representing the twelve months. Although the original number of panels remains an open question, most scholars now believe there were only six panels, as scenes that would traditionally have appeared in two separate months in contemporary Calendar series (a theme common in illuminated manuscripts) are included in a single image. This panel is usually identified as representing July–August, or late summer.
Bruegel's drawing Spring (Albertina, Vienna) is inscribed by the artist ""De Lenten Meert April Meij,"" and may resemble in subject the missing panel of the months that presumably represented April-May or early spring."
Hunters in the Snow,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"In his typical peasant genre with landscape scene, Hunters in the Snow is one in a series of six (five surviving) paintings by Brueghel depicting the different seasons of the year. The scene is of hunters returning with their dogs from an unsuccessful hunting expedition. Scientists have used his portrayal of the wintry scene to corroborate evidence on the severity of the Little Ice Age, during which the painting was created. Also created during a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, Brueghel is giving us a secular illustration of what country life should look like."
The Return of the Herd (November),Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"landscape, genre painting","The Return of the Herd is one of a cycle depicting the months, five paintings of which have survived. This picture presumably depicts November.

Many of Bruegel's paintings show people not so much as the masters of nature but rather as a part of it: there is hardly any difference here between the coloration of the cattle and that of their drovers.

November is the month in which the cattle return to their winter quarters from the summer pastures and Bruegel shows them being driven towards the hill-top village. In this panel Bruegel's remarkable technique can be studied at its best. Individual forms are built up with the greatest economy. Within the sketched outline the paint is laid on thinly, sometimes with an almost dry brush. The light brown gesso underpainting is allowed to show through, in this instance giving a warm brown tone to the whole foreground. Bruegel must have composed the Months largely on the panels themselves; only one preparatory drawing on paper survives, a study for one of the hunters in The Hunters in the Snow, the January panel. Having prepared the panel, Bruegel drew the outlines of the composition in paint with a thin brush and then added the thinly-scraped areas of colour within those outlines."
Census at Bethlehem,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,genre painting,"As often before, Bruegel treats a biblical story as a contemporary event. And once again, reference to particular political events has been adduced - in this case, the severity of the Spanish administration in the southern Netherlands. However, Bruegel may well be making a more general criticism of bureaucratic methods.This is a rare subject in previous Netherlandish art."
The Adoration of the Kings in the Snow,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,"genre painting, religious painting","Bruegel has shifted the Adoration from the centre to the left-hand edge of the picture, depicting it rather indistinctly behind a curtain of snow. The work is characterized not by the religious motif but by a natural event and the life of the people in a village in wintertime. It is possible that we have here the first painting in the history of European art to depict falling snow."
Land of Cockaigne,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,mythological painting,"In medieval times, Cockaigne was a mythical land of plenty, but Bruegel's depiction of Cockaigne and its residents is not meant to be a flattering one. He chooses rather a comic illustration of the spiritual emptiness believed to derive from gluttony and sloth, two of the seven deadly sins."
The Storm at Sea,Bruegel the Elder Pieter,Northern Renaissance,marina,"In the past doubts have been raised about the attribution of this painting to Bruegel: the name of Joos de Momper, a landscape painter who became a master in the Antwerp guild in 1581, has been mentioned. However, not only is this painting superior to any by de Momper; its similarity to a drawing by Bruegelsee image below and its originality of composition and delicacy of execution have made it generally accepted as a late work by Bruegel, possibly left unfinished at his death."
Our Lady of Piety,Michelangelo,Early Renaissance,sculpture,"The Madonna della Pietà (Italian: [maˈdɔnna della pjeˈta]; ""Our Lady of Piety""; 1498–1499), otherwise known as Pietà, is a Carrara marble sculpture of Jesus and Mary at Mount Golgotha representing the ""Sixth Sorrow"" of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Michelangelo Buonarroti, now located in Saint Peter's Basilica, Vatican City. It is a key work of Italian Renaissance sculpture and often taken as the start of the High Renaissance."
David,Michelangelo,High Renaissance,sculpture,"David is a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created between 1501 and 1504, by the Italian artist Michelangelo. It is a 5.17-metre (17.0 ft) marble statue of a standing male nude. The statue represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of Florence. It is possible that the David was conceived as a political statue before Michelangelo began to work on it. Certainly David the giant-killer had long been seen as a political figure in Florence, and images of the Biblical hero already carried political implications there."
Blue rider,Kandinsky Wassily,Expressionism,landscape,"The Blue Rider is perhaps Kandinsky’s most important painting from the early 1900’s, before he had fully developed his abstract style of music as sound. The painting illustrates a rider cloaked in blue, speeding through a greenish meadow. The painting’s intentional abstractness had led many art theorists to project their own representations onto the figure, some seeing a child in the arms of the blue rider. Allowing viewers to participate in the representations of the art was a technique that Kandinsky would use to great fruition in his many later works, which became more and more abstract as his career wore on."
Composition IV,Kandinsky Wassily,Abstract Art,abstract,"An interesting story that indicates Kandinsky’s intellectual examination in the creation of his works revolves around this composition. He became exhausted during the months of studying he went through in preparation for this painting, and decided to go for a walk. His assistant at the time, Gabrielle Munter, who was tidying up the studio in the artist’s absence, inadvertently turned the canvas on its side. Upon Kandinsky’s return, he saw the canvas, fell to his knees and began weeping at the beauty of the painting. His newly found perspective on the piece would change his artistic vision and direction for the rest of his life."
Composition VI,Kandinsky Wassily,Abstract Art,abstract,"Kandinsky spent nearly six months preparing to create this painting, at first intending the work to evoke a flood, baptism, destruction and rebirth all at the same time. He first outlined the work on an oversized wooden panel, but soon experienced an artistic block, and found himself unable to paint. Gabrielle Munter, his assistant at the time, told him that he was blocked, and he needed to release himself from his intellectual trappings surrounding the painting. She suggested that he simply repeat the word “uberflut,” meaning “flood” or “deluge,” focusing on the sound of the word rather than its meaning, releasing his mind from the artistic block and focusing only on the music of the word. Kandinsky set down to work, and completed the painting in three days, all the while repeating the word like a mantra."
On White II,Kandinsky Wassily,Abstract Art,abstract,"Kandinsky’s On White II expresses an intelligent combination of the two main colors in the painting: black and white. Kandinsky used color to represent more than just shapes and figures in his paintings. In this painting the many dimensions of the color white is used to represent the many possibilities and opportunities available in life. The color black, on the other hand, represents non-existence and death. Kandinsky expressed the color black as the silence of death, and in this painting, the black cuts through the white background with a riotous effect, shattering the peace of the colorful combination of colors, or as it were, opportunities in life."
Composition X,Kandinsky Wassily,Abstract Art,abstract,"Kandinsky often related the painting of colors and pictures on a canvas to the composition of beautiful music, and as such, named many of his paintings variants of Composition. His analogy of art as a musical composition revolved around the piano: the eyes were the hammers, the color is the keyboard, and the soul is the piano and strings. Similar to music, which is not just jumbles of notes, Kandinsky’s works were not just amalgamations of non distinct shapes and colors. They were carefully arranged musical elements, precisely proportioned to evoke the maximum aesthetic and emotional response from the viewer."
Song of the Blue Clouds,Malevich Kazimir,Symbolism,portrait,"Sketch for a Portrait of the Composer Roslavets, 1907-1908. Collection Stedelijk Museum Khardzhiev-Chaga."
Morning in the Village after Snowstorm,Malevich Kazimir,Cubo-Futurism,genre painting,"Morning in the Village after Snowstorm is a perfect example of Russian Cubo-Futurism. Not quite cubism, it was a method of portraying object via geometric shapes. This painting was created by Malevich in his earlier career, when his paintings were still representational and he had not clearly delineated his theories of suprematism. Russian art can usually fall within two vast categories: that of a unique artistic style and technique, and that which depicts the social life of the Russian people. Although Malevich’s paintings are often in the first category, this painting does have some elements of social awareness. His depiction of Russian peasants, trudging through a snowstorm, five years before the Russian Revolution, cannot be a mere coincidence."
Black Square,Malevich Kazimir,Suprematism,abstract,"One of the most famous paintings in Russian art, Black Square marked the turning point of the Russian avant-garde movement. Before creating this painting, Malevich spent eighteen months in his studio, laboring over thirty non-objective paintings. In the end, he had created a series of non-objective paintings, of which Black Square is one. His invention of the word “suprematism” was meant to refer to the supremacy of the new geometric forms. Although the other works in this period were created with visual brushstrokes and asymmetrical forms, Black Square was the prominent piece, with no visual textures and a perfectly symmetrical shape, as it was the paramount of Malevich’s change to pure geometric abstraction: suprematism."
Red square,Malevich Kazimir,Suprematism,abstract,"Red Square (Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimensions) (formally titled Painterly Realism of a Peasant Woman in Two Dimensions, more commonly known as Red Square) is a 1915 painting by Kazimir Malevich.
The painting is of a red parallelogram on a white field. According to New York Times art critic Grace Gluek, the ""Peasant Woman"" of the title of the work is represented in the color red of traditional Russian religious icon paintings."
Suprematist Composition,Malevich Kazimir,Suprematism,abstract,"Suprematist Composition was completed in the same year Malevich wrote his Suprematist Manifesto, in which he expounded his artistic theory of suprematism. This painting is renowned as the masterpiece of the suprematist movement, one of the most innovative art movements of the 20th century. It is now considered the paradigm of the Russian avant-garde and an icon in all of Russian art. The painting made its debut at the 1919-1920 State Exhibition in Moscow, quickly establishing Malevich as one of the most influential artists of his era. It was sold at auction in 2008 for a record-setting $60 million, a record price for any Russian piece of art."
Sketchbook,Malevich Kazimir,Suprematism,"abstract, sketch and study","During the 1910's Malevich shared and drove the magnificent adventure of the early Russian avant-garde. As a major artist, he expressed his creative genius from the Neo-Primitive period onwards, through to Cubo-Futurism. Overtaking the Neo-Primitive, Cubo-Futurist and alogical phases allowed for the genesis of an art in which forms and colors became moving, colored masses. By 1916, Suprematism had become a revolution at the heart of the avant-garde itself, a singular path upon which Malevich was joined by several disciples including Olga Rozanova, Ivan Kliun, Ilya Chashnik and Nikolai Suetin. He founded the Supremus group and became the most radical and charismatic avant-garde leader to date. In 1917, Nikolay Punin noted that Supermatism was blossoming like an opulent flower all over Moscow; from signboards and exhibitions to cafés, everything was suprematist. The famous black square was exhibited in 1915, shown in a niche in which Russians place their icons for worship, we notice that on these sketches and watercolor drafts the colored quadrangle is, objectively speaking, the foundation of the composition. It is from this form that the other elements spring, before finding their position in the pictorial space. In confirming that his Black Square, or Black Quadrangle, dates from 1913, Malevich was linking this affirmation to his costume designs for the opera Victory over the Sun. In December 1913, Malevich, Matyushin and Kruchenykh staged an opera, the importance of which was due to much more than the fact that it represented the birth of futurist opera in Russia: it opened the doors to a way of perceiving the world. Kazimir Malevich himself said that it was his work on the costumes and sets that had engendered the discovery of the suprematist system. During the Summer of 1915 alongside the publication of his pamphlet, he wrote to Matyushin, asking to include some of his sketches: “regarding the drawings, something made in total unconsciousness has borne unexpected fruits.” Matyushin decided to publish a new version of the pamphlet, including sketches by Kazimir Malevich selected with this in mind, one of which was a black square destined for the stage curtain. Malevich explained his choice: ""the black square is the source of all possibility. In its actualization it contains the colossal force of the cube and the sphere; its disintegration brings a remarkable culture to painting. It is the ancestor of both the cube and of the sphere."" As the drawing had a real existence, Kazimir Malevich was entitled to consider the year 1913 as the birth date of the black square. Even though, strictly speaking, there was no curtain with a black square, a sketch featuring white and black squares certainly exists in the eyes of several experts, containing within it the artistic genesis of the black quadrangle. In the inscription for the drawing, tableau 5, tableau 1, act 2, square, act 2, the word ‘square’ seems to have been inserted when Malevich later modified the date. And so the black square’s reign began: ""the appearance of the ‘black square’ in the work of Malevich and in 20th century art in a wider sense, is striking for its abrupt, unexpected, unpredictable nature.” (J.Cl. Marcadé, Cahier I, p. 115) Malevich adopted a trilogy for the squares according to their color and often quoted them grouped in the same order: black, red, white (Suprematism: 34 Drawings). In its historical development All three of these periods of development took place between 1913 and 1918. They were all played out under the conventional signs of surface-planes, that go some way to express the planes of the future bodies, in volume. Remember, as Malevich wrote, the space of a painting is not that of the earth and the relationship with the shapes that we know in the space of the earth and the shapes contained in the pictorial space of his paintings, have nothing in common. They do not obey the same rules. The three suprematist squares represent the establishment of visions and constructions of the world that are very precise. In daily life, these squares carried yet another meaning: the black square was a sign of the economy, the red square a sign of revolution and the white square a sign of pure movement, pure action. The presence of the squares in the Sketchbook receives the same, constant interpretation in the writings of Kazimir Malevich; the circular lines that figure in these pencil and watercolor drawings numbered 8, 11, 12, 13, seem to be an allusion to the opera Victory over the Sun. Some sketches are likely to have been preliminary work for oils on canvas (K.Malevich, Suprematist Composition, 1916, oil on canvas, 80.5cm x 71cm, MNR, JB-1421) , others were made to demonstrate, support and analyze the journey of an artist-teacher who was still searching for his truth."
Suprematist Composition: White on White,Malevich Kazimir,Suprematism,abstract,"Optimistic about the Russian Revolution, Malevich thought that the newfound freedom wound open the door to a new society, where materialism allowed for spiritual freedom. In his efforts, he studied aerial photography, and this painting is an effort make the the top square seem as if it is floating above the canvas. The stark canvas on White on White it is not devoid of emotion or deep artistic sentiment. Malevich’s brushstrokes are evident, and the soft outlines of the imprecise square make the white austerity of the painting seem more human. When it was created, it was one of the most radical paintings of its day, without reference to any outside reality."

The Running Man,Malevich Kazimir,Neo-Suprematism,genre painting,"After pioneering a new form of artistic abstraction, Malevich turned to pioneering a new way of representing the human form, making a variety of new humanoid figures. This particular painting also has a very specific story. The running figure is said to be a representation of the Soviet government, running away after the persecution and murder of peasants. The humanoid figure runs through the canvas, evincing a mood of panic and fear. A bloodied sword of violence stands upright in the background. At this time in Malevich’s career, he was being persecuted by the Soviet government, and as such this painting is more than a representation of a social wrong, it was a personal condemnation of the violence that had been done to him."
Skull,Basquiat Jean-Michel ,,,"Basquiat was a precocious child, and at the age of seven, his mother gave him a copy of Gray’s Anatomy, which he later used as a reference to create his masterful and deconstructed figures. In this painting, Basquiat presents us with a face in the shape of a skull. Although complete with eyes, a nose, and teeth, the painting gives us the illusion that the face is incomplete, and the bones from underneath the surface are coming through just as plainly as the colors in the background. The head is filled with Basquiat’s illusory graffiti, giving the impression there are forms and figures within the face, but upon closer inspection, the face is a shambles of abstract lines and shapes."
Irony of the Negro Policeman,Basquiat Jean-Michel ,,,"Basquiat’s Irony of Negro Policeman is a sharp critique on members of his own race. By depicting a Negro policeman, he is making a conscious effort to show how African-Americans are controlled by the white majority in America. Basquiat found it utterly ironic that any African-American would be a policeman, working to enforce rules that were meant to enslave themselves. The figure in the paintings is a totalitarian black mass, with a mask-like face and hat resembling a cage. On the right of the painting are the words “Irony of Negro Policeman,” and to the bottom right of the panting is the word “Pawn,” clearly stating Basquiat’s opinion on the ridiculous position of a Negro Policeman."
Untitled (Gem Spa),Basquiat Jean-Michel ,,,Untitled (Gem Spa) by Jean-Michel Basquiat 1982
Boxer,Basquiat Jean-Michel ,,,"This painting, which depicts a black boxer in the foreground of a white graffiti-filled backdrop, was sold at auction for $13.5 million in 2008. It had been held as part of the private collection of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy metal band Metallica, who decided to sell this painting along with Basquiat’s other masterpiece Profit I in order to raise funds to build a house for his family. This painting is a typical example of Basquiat’s bold graffiti style, used to enhance a heroic art piece into a full examination of the character’s figure and stance, from the skeleton -like smile to the disfigures musculature in the arms and laces of the boxing gloves."
Profit I,Basquiat Jean-Michel ,,,"Created in Italy in 1982, at the height of his fame, Profit I is one of Basquiat’s most masterful works. In this painting, Basquiat mixes the precedent of historical painting with urban graffiti to create a heroic character that is part self-portrait and part voodoo shaman. This painting, since creation, has been in the collections of two art galleries, as well as the personal collection of Lars Ulrich, from the heavy metal band Metallica. Ulrich, who fought to buy the painting from the Swiss dealer Bruno Bischofberger, reluctantly sold the painting at auction in 2002 in order to raise funds to build a house for his growing family."
Music in the Tuileries Garden,Manet Edouard,Impressionism,genre painting,"One of Manet’s earlier paintings, Music in the Tuileries shows the influence of Frans Hals and Diego Velázquez on Manet’s artistic style. The quick visible brush strokes seemed to some to indicate that the painting was not finished, but it is a true representation of what the Tuilerie gardens were like, crowded and full of noise. Manet, whose paintings often depicted scenes of leisurely activities, has included many of his friends as well as a self portrait in this work. Among the figures you can find Charles Baudelaire, Theophile Gautier, Henri Fantin-Latour, Jacques Offenbach, Manet’s brother Eugene, and a self portrait of the artist himself."
"Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire's Mistress, Reclining (Lady with a Fan)",Manet Edouard,Realism,portrait,"The influence of Spanish painting, primarily of Velázquez and Goya, on Manet’s pictures painted in the early 1860s is striking. This portrait, painted in 1862, depicts Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire’s mulatto mistress. Manet met the poet at the end of the 1850s, and was profoundly influenced by his artistic principles. The composition follows the then fashionable patterns of portrait­ure, but its strident tone had a provocative effect on the prevailing taste. The slightly stiff posture and the rough facial features show the “Black Venus” worn down by illness: she had been suffering from polio for years. The master was experimenting with the composition as it is demonstrated by a preliminary study in watercolour in the Kunsthalle, Bremen."
Olympia,Manet Edouard,Realism,nude painting (nu),"When Manet exhibited Olympia at the Paris Salon in 1865, it caused an immediate sensation. Although it was immediately condemned as “immoral” and “vulgar” by conservative critics, it was lauded by critics such as Emile Zola, the French writer, who proclaimed the painting to be Manet’s masterpiece. Unlike Titian’s Venus de Urbino or Giorgione’s Sleeping Venus, both of which were sources of inspiration for Olympia, Manet’s work was overtly sexual. The small bits of clothing, such as the orchid in her hair, jewelry, and the mule slippers, in addition to the fully clothed servant, seem to make the figure seem even more nude. Her confrontational gaze was an affront to the perfunctory modesty with which women were supposed to behave."
The Luncheon on the Grass,Manet Edouard,Realism,genre painting,"The Luncheon in the Grass, with its depiction of a nude female with fully clothed men was a controversial piece when it was displayed at the Salon de Refuses in 1863. It was considered an affront to the times, not only because of the stark nudity of the woman in contrast to the men but also because Manet used familiar models for the figures in the painting. The nude woman is a combination of both his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff, and one of his other female models, Victorine Meurent. The men, on the other hand, are his brother, Eugene Manet, and his brother in law, Ferdinand Leenhoff. It was also considered controversial because it illustrated the rampant prostitution in Paris at the time, which was a taboo subject just to mention, much less display in an oversized canvas."
Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus,Manet Edouard,Impressionism,portrait,"The Portrait of Mademoiselle Claus was an early version of Manet’s more famous work The Balcony where Mademoiselle Claus is pictured with Berthe Morisot and Antoine Guillemet. The unfinished, earlier version was painted in 1868. Shortly after Manet’s death, it was purchased by John Singer Sargent in 1884. It has only been publicly shown once in the last 100 years at the National Gallery during a retrospective of the artist’s works on the 100th anniversary of his death."
Monet in his Studio Boat,Manet Edouard,Impressionism,genre painting,"Manet painted Claude Monet in his Studio Boat in the summer of 1874 at Gennevilliers.

Partly no doubt because he was more interested in the old masters than the other Impressionists and took a more traditional view of the painter’s role in society, Manet was slow to take up the idea of painting on the spot, in the open air.

But that summer it all changed quite dramatically when he spent some time painting with Monet and Renoir at Argenteuil, a small town just down-river from Paris. There it was Monet’s convictions which especially affected him, and although he never became particularly interested in landscape as such, took to painting people out of doors.

Here he has captured Monet and his wife Camille in the boat which the painter used as a floating studio, rowing it up and down the Seine and stopping whenever he spotted a promising subject. Monet was often desperately poor, but could always rely on a loan from Manet – who was equally unpopular but less dependent on art for his income.

Thanks to Monet’s influence, Manet painted more often in the open air and lightened his palette. This picture receives a new freedom in treatment, Manet using smaller, more sketchy strokes and a brighter range of colors, and picking up in typical Impressionist fashion the light reflected from water and the almost abstract play of colors broken up by the ripples.

Monet used the ‘floating studio’ to paint many scenes along the River Seine, capturing ‘the effects of light from one twilight to the next’. Manet was to describe Monet as “the Raphael of water”."
The Monet family in their garden at Argenteuil,Manet Edouard,Impressionism,genre painting,"By 1874 Manet came under the sway of Monet's approach to painting quickly, out of doors. In the summer of that year, Manet stayed at his family's house in Gennevilliers, just across the Seine from Monet in Argenteuil. The Monet family was living in a house that Manet had helped them find the year before. This portrait of the Monet family—Camille Monet and Jean, with Claude Monet gardening at the left—is one of Manet's most significant essays in this new style. While Manet painted the Monet family, Renoir painted beside him and Monet worked nearby. Monet painted Manet at his easel (present location unknown), while Renoir, like Manet, painted Madame Monet, Jean Monet, and the rooster (http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/camille-monet-and-her-son-jean-in-the-garden-at-argenteuil-1874). In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: ""Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor painting of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy! Since you are his friend, tell him to give up painting!'"""
The Grand Canal of Venice (Blue Venice),Manet Edouard,Impressionism,cityscape,"Manet visited the Grand Canal Venice in September 1875 with his friend and fellow painter from outside the Impressionist circle James Tissot, who had settled in London after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. Although the watery splendour of Venice has inspired many great artists, Manet found it hard to settle, but in spite of this he managed to paint one of his most dashingly Impressionist art works."
Self Portrait with a Palette,Manet Edouard,Impressionism,self-portrait,"Although Manet often painted himself into his scenes, this self-portrait is one of only two of just the artist himself. The painting, which was painted in the style of Diego Velazquez self-portrait in Las Meninas, portrays the artist in a brown coat and cap, paint brush and palette in hand. Although the painting shows the brush in the left hand, we can assume that it was mirror image, as Manet was right handed. X-ray analysis of this work has shown that Manet painted over a portrait of his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff (Manet), in profile. This is the only self-portrait in which Manet depicted himself as an artist, as he has included himself in many of his other paintings, albeit as a figure in the scene, as in Music in the Tuileries and The Ball of the Opera."
A Bar at the Folies-Bergere,Manet Edouard,Impressionism,genre painting,"This painting, depicting a scene at the Folies-Bergere nightclub in Paris, is considered Manet’s last major work. It can also be seen as early twentieth century product placement, with the beers in the foreground on the bar, which are clearly Bass Pale Ale. As England’s first registered trademark, this indicated an English clientele at the bar that night. There has also been much commentary on the composition of the painting, which at first seems to be a mirror image of the girl in the background. Upon closer inspection, however, it is obvious that the placement is incorrect, that it cannot be a mirror image. Other conjectures include that the woman in the foreground is the illustration of what the man in the background is seeing upon approaching the bar."
The Harvest of Hay in Eragny,Pissarro Camille ,"Pointillism, Neo-Impressionism",genre painting,"This painting depicts a hay harvesting scene in the countryside near Éragny, where the artist lived with his family from 1884 until his death in 1903. In the center of the canvas, a woman uses a hayfork while behind her others do similar work in a brightly lit field punctuated by haystacks.

Pissarro adopted the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism]Pointillist[/url] technique in 1886, saying that ""[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-impressionism]Neo-Impressionism[/url] was the next phase in the logical march of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionism[/url]."" What set his work apart from the other Neo-Impressionists was his emphasis on rural life and labor. Pissarro's depiction of peasant life along with his own scientific explorations of color speaks to the anarchist theories he adopted in the latter half of the 1870s.

Pissarro felt that his scientific studies freed him from the Academy's strictures of how to see and depict reality. He also evoked the utopian visions of peasant societies he read about in the writings of anarchists Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin. Pissarro wanted ""to educate the public,"" by portraying the common man, but he also wanted to avoid idealizing and sentimentalizing his subjects. In this work, he depicts the effort of hay harvesting, both in the man at the left arching his back to toss the hay up and in the woman at the center, the strength palpable in her back and shoulders."
Drawing XIII,O'Keeffe Georgia,Precisionism,abstract,"In drawings like this, O'Keeffe asserted her independence from her traditional art training. Filling large sheets of paper with bold strokes of charcoal, her compositions evoke the growth and movement of nature through abstract forms. Here, the image is divided into three parallel sections. On the right, meandering lines suggest a flowing river or a rising flame. Four rounded bulbs in the center recall a rolling hillside or densely foliated trees, while the jagged line at left, accentuated by erasure marks, alludes to mountain peaks or a flash of lightning. The power of these early drawings was not lost on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-stieglitz]Alfred Stieglitz[/url], who immediately offered to show [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/drawing-xii-1916]Drawing XII[/url], XIII[/i] and other O'Keeffe charcoals in an exhibition at his Gallery 291 in 1916."
Drawing XII,O'Keeffe Georgia,Precisionism,abstract,"In January 1916, when O'Keeffe was an unknown art teacher living in South Carolina, a friend of the young artist’s brought a group of her abstract drawings to the influential editor, photographer, and gallerist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-stieglitz]Alfred Stieglitz[/url]. Later that year, without O'Keeffe's knowledge, Stieglitz decided to exhibit the drawings at his Gallery 291, promoting both their homegrown abstraction and their maker’s gender: ""291 had never before seen a woman express herself so frankly on paper."" When O’Keeffe found out, she was furious and demanded they be taken down, but Stieglitz refused. The exhibition launched her career."
"Ram's Head, White Hollyhock-Hills",O'Keeffe Georgia,Precisionism,landscape,"Georgia O’Keeffe maintained a great admiration for the Southwest part of the United States. In the mid-1920s, O’Keeffe felt doubts about the paintings she were doing; she wrote in a letter to a friend: “I do not seem to be crystallizing anything this winter. I am not clear. I am not steady on my feet.” Her relationship with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-stieglitz]Alfred Stieglitz[/url] deteriorated and she was suffering health problems. O’Keeffe wanted to take a break from New York, so in 1929, she departed to visit New Mexico. This decision was just the beginning of a powerful romance that lasted until her death.
 
During her travels, O’Keeffe wrote: “I never feel at home in the East like I do out here. And finally feeling in the right place again –I feel like myself– and I like it.” She resided in the West till the summer of 1930, and produced over 30 paintings there. But it was not until 1935 that she painted [i]Ram’s Head, White Hollyhock-Hills[/i].
 
This artwork distills much of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/precisionism]Precisionism[/url], and also of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The juxtaposition of a skull and the landscape of New Mexico was something never seen before. For O’Keeffe, those bones became an important subject to depict in her pieces because they represented the lasting beauty of the desert and the toughness of the American spirit. It seems like the blue of the sky stands out even more than the skull and the white hollyhock. The hollyhock creates a contrast impossible to ignore. If the skull and the mountains represent the American strength, the white hollyhock may symbolize the fertility of this landscape. Despite feeling terribly miscomprehended before for her flower paintings, O’Keeffe returned continuously to them as subjects.
 
The hills were quite a challenge to paint for her; O’Keeffe wrote about this: “I had looked out on the hills for weeks and painted them again and again —had climbed and ridden over them— so beautifully soft, so difficult. I had painted those hills from the car in bright sunlight and had failed dismally but I could see them—farther away—from my window in the rain. So I tried again,” -  until she conquered them."
The treachery of images (This is not a pipe),Magritte Rene,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"'The Treachery of Images' cleverly highlights the gap between language and meaning. Magritte combined the words and image in such a fashion that he forces us to question the importance of the sentence and the word. ""Pipe,"" for instance, is no more an actual pipe than a picture of a pipe can be smoked. Magritte likely borrowed the pipe motif from Le Corbusier's book 'Vers une architecture' (1923), since he was admirer of the architect and painter, but he may also have been inspired by a comical sign he knew in an art gallery, which read, ""Ceci n'est pas de l'Art."" The painting is the subject of a famous book-length analysis by Michel Foucault. One might also compare it with Joseph Kosuth's handling of a similar problem of image, text, and reality in his 1965 installation 'One and Three Chairs'."
The human condition,Magritte Rene,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"Magritte painted two of these paintings with the same name, The Human Condition, the most well-known of which is the version painted in 1935. A recurring theme in Magritte’s works is illustrating an object that is covering up whatever is behind it. In this painting, the easel used to paint the seascape outside of the doorway is also hiding the doorway, as well as the seascape. The image painted on the canvas also merges with the actual image outside of the doorway, making a seamless transition between the two. Magritte recycled this theme recurrently throughout his painting career, making many variations on the theme of including a painting within a painting, hiding whatever lies behind."
The Listening Room,Magritte Rene,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"Magritte created two versions of this painting, of the same name, which both portray a large green apple in the middle of a room. This painting illustrates the many themes running through Magritte’s work. The first is the apple, which he uses to great lengths in many of his works, the most famous of which is The Son of Man, depicting a man wearing a bowling hat, with a green apple covering his face. The other theme is that of placing objects together in an unusual context. Unlike other surrealist artists, who mixed dreamlike images with abstract shapes, Magritte’s works included normal images, placed in surreal contextual situations. The Listening Room is one such painting, portraying a regular green apple, which just so happens to be large enough to fill an entire room."
Golconda,Magritte Rene,Surrealism,cityscape,"Magritte got the name for this painting from his poet friend Louis Scutenaire, who often helped him find names for his paintings. In this case, the name Golconda refers to a city in India, which was the seat for two different kingdoms from the 14th to 17th centuries. The richness of the region, as it was the center of the diamond industry, has become so legendary that the name is now synonymous with “mine of wealth.” As a tribute to his friend Scutenaire, Magritte used his face for the man in the painting closest to the chimney on the right hand side."
Sixteenth of September,Magritte Rene,Surrealism,landscape,"Here Magritte superimposes a crescent moon in front of the tree. The artist referred to his intentional juxtaposition of incongruous objects as ""objective stimulus."" In reference to this image, Magritte observed: ""I have just painted the moon on a tree in the grey-blue colors of evening."" Typically, the titles of Magritte's paintings were determined after they were completed. In this case, the title was the idea of Magritte's friend, Surrealist poet Louis Scutenaire. unstable building, the artist seeks to subvert the laws of physics, as well as to question the viewer's perception of an image so deeply rooted in common culture."
The Son of Man,Magritte Rene,Surrealism,self-portrait,"Magritte created two versions of this painting, of the same name, which both portray a large green apple in the middle of a room. This painting illustrates the many themes running through Magritte’s work. The first is the apple, which he uses to great lengths in many of his works, the most famous of which is The Son of Man, depicting a man wearing a bowling hat, with a green apple covering his face. The other theme is that of placing objects together in an unusual context. Unlike other surrealist artists, who mixed dreamlike images with abstract shapes, Magritte’s works included normal images, placed in surreal contextual situations. The Listening Room is one such painting, portraying a regular green apple, which just so happens to be large enough to fill and entire room."
The Scream,Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,genre painting,"The Scream is the best known and most frequently reproduced of all Munch’s motifs. With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.

Despite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all.

As with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”.

The Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints."
The Scream,Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,genre painting,"As the earliest version of The Scream, this pastel appears to be the sketch in which Munch mapped out the essentials of the composition."
Madonna,Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,religious painting,"Madonna was another painting of which Munch made many reproductions. Although it is a very unique representation, this painting depicts Mary, Mother of Jesus. Unlike the typical depiction of Mary as a fully clothed, chaste woman, this piece portrays her as a fully developed, sexually mature woman. This painting was stolen along with The Scream in 2004. Although the thieves were immediately caught, it was thought that they destroyed the two paintings, which were evidence of their crime. The Norwegian government offered a 2 million kroner reward, but the paintings were not returned. Finally, in 2006, the Norwegian government obtained the paintings in an undisclosed operation, retuning the two painting to the museum under tight security."
Puberty,Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,nude painting (nu),"Created in the 1890’s when Munch was beginning to establish himself in the art world, Puberty is a representation of Munch’s sexual repression. The painting is ripe with tension. It depicts a young pubertal girl, nude, sitting with her legs together in a shy pose. It is at once a respectful representation of the girl’s awareness of her changing body, as well as an indication of repressed sexual desire. There are also theories that Munch has represented himself in the figure of the girl and that he illustrated his own undeveloped sexual desires in the form of the girl. As such, it has generated much controversy, including many conjectures about the model, the meaning of the painting, and its genesis."
The Scream,Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,genre painting,"This version of The Scream was sold for more than US$120 million, at Sotheby's, in 2012."
Kiss,Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,genre painting,"Munch created many works in a thematic vein, including The Kiss, and exhibited them along side each other in what he called The Freize of Life. The themes in the series ranged from love and death, sex, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy and the stages of life, and included the famous painting The Scream. This painting captures an intimate moment between two nudes, the woman pulling the man towards her in a lover’s embrace, mouths locked in a passionate kiss, and is an example of Munch’s theme of the femme fatal as the dominant creature, taking control to feed her sexual appetite."
Edvard Munch - Garden in Taarbaek,Munch Edvard ,Impressionism,landscape,"Edvard Munch spent the summer of 1905 in Taarbaek, a seaside resort on the outskirts of Copenhagen. The tranquil mood of the season is eloquently captured in Garden in Taarbaek, one of the artist's most serene compositions."
The Sick Child (later),Munch Edvard ,Expressionism,genre painting,"Munch had a troubled familial past. In addition to his overbearing pietist father, his mother died of tuberculosis when he was a small child, and his sister died nine years later of the same disease. This painting is an image of Munch’s older and favorite sister Sophie lying in bed, dying of tuberculosis when she was 15 years old. Munch created many reproductions of this painting, including one that was held in Dresden, Germany. In the 1930’s and 40’s Nazi’s deemed Munch’s art as “degenerate art” and removed all of them from Germany to be sold at auction. This piece was bought and later donated to the Tate Gallery in London, where it remains today."

"Cornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk",Gainsborough Thomas,Rococo,landscape,"The painting [i]Cornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk[/i] (1748) depicts wood located two miles from Sudbury, the artist’s place of birth. Cornard Wood was common land situated on the outskirts of the village of Great Cornard. Gainsborough painted the view from Abbas Hall, looking towards the village of Great Henny with the church of St. Mary’s Great Henny appearing in the background.

Since the woods were not private property, the villagers could gather wood, graze donkeys and horses, dig marl for manure or sand for building materials, or simply take a walk on the path to Great Henny. In the painting, the artist depicts the activities that embody the spirit of the countryside: two donkeys stand on a mound, a man is resting from digging while a lady sits nearby, another man cuts and ties firewood, and travelers head towards Great Henny on foot and on horseback.

In a letter Gainsborough wrote in 1788 he revealed that the landscape was painted in 1748 at a time when he was still learning his craft. Gainsborough began teaching himself to paint by studying and copying landscapes of 17th-century Dutch artists, particularly Jan Wijnants and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-van-ruisdael]Jacob van Ruisdael[/url]. Dutch landscapes appealed to artists who preferred a more naturalistic approach to the ideal classical landscapes of French painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-lorrain]Claude Lorrain[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Nicolas Poussin[/url]. The young artist could have familiarized himself with these paintings in the East Anglian collections as well as in the form of engravings. Additionally, the East Anglia countryside with its wetlands, ponds, and windmills shared similarities with the Netherlands’ landscape. Like in Ruisdael’s wooded scenes such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-van-ruisdael/landscape-with-a-house-in-the-grove-1646][i]Peasant Cottage in a Landscape[/i][/url] (c. 1646), Gainsborough scatters human figures around the woodland to create a harmonious and humble atmosphere. It has even been suggested that Gainsborough painted some of these early landscapes hoping to attract a clientele that was fond of Dutch art.

Later in life, Gainsborough expressed a fondness and nostalgia for these early works, since he believed they demonstrated his lifelong commitment to landscape painting. He wrote about Cornard Wood, near Sudbury, Suffolk: “though there is very little idea of composition in the picture, the touch and closeness to nature […] are equal to any of my later productions”. He also revealed that in a period of 40 years the painting was held by 20 different picture dealers and that at one point he even bought the painting back for himself. For a few years, the painting belonged to David Pike Watts, the uncle of the English landscape painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-constable]John Constable[/url]. Thus, Constable likely knew and admired the painting. He was born in the same area as Gainsborough and was also inspired by the local landscape. In 1800, when Constable was painting near Woodbridge in Suffolk, he wrote: “It is a most delightful country for a landscape painter, I fancy I see Gainsborough in every hedge and hollow tree”."
Mr. and Mrs. Andrews,Gainsborough Thomas,Rococo,portrait,"One of the most famous paintings by Thomas Gainsborough is the portrait [i]Mr. and Mrs. Andrews[/i] (1750), which the artist painted when he was only 21 years old. The painting depicts the landowner Robert Andrews and his young wife Frances Andrews sitting on a bench in front of an English countryside landscape. The portrait was commissioned in 1750, two years after the couple married in the parish church of All Saints, Sudbury. However, the painting is not a marriage portrait, instead, it likely celebrated the inheritance Andrews received in 1750. Thus, the painting can be considered a ‘triple’ portrait – of Mr. Andrews, his wife, and his land. 

The couple is dressed casually, their attire is suited for an informal outing. Mr. Andrews is wearing a baggy shooting jacket with bags of powder and shot hanging from his pocket. He is holding a long-barreled shotgun and his dog is at his feet. Mrs. Andrews wears a simple light blue skirt and jacket, and a pair of casual heels. The portrait can be categorized as a ‘conversation piece’, a type of group portrait popular in 18th century England. The conversation piece is a kind of informal portrait: it usually depicts a group of family members or friends in a rural or domestic setting.

In this early masterpiece, Gainsborough prominently features the naturalistic landscapes, that dominates the right side of the canvas. The artist was particularly fond of landscape painting, and in this case, he used the landscape to display his painterly skills. He creates the effect of changing weather, depicting stormy skies with patches of light and shadow that fall over the fields and meadows. This technique was common in Dutch 17th-century landscape painting, which influenced Gainsborough’s style of painting. This relatively small piece (69.8 cm × 119.4 cm) was typical of Gainsborough’s work in this early period. His later portraits such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/portrait-of-colonel-john-bullock][i]Portrait of Colonel John Bullock[/i][/url] (ca. 1780) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/mrs-richard-brinsley-sheridan-1786][i]Mrs. Richard Brinsley Sheridan[/i][/url] (1785-1787) were much grandeur and painted on larger, close to life-size formats. In these later works, the figure takes center stage, while the landscape in the background becomes more generalized.

In the painting, Gainsborough left an unpainted patch in Mrs. Andrews's lap. The reason behind this is unknown: some speculate the artist planned to paint a cock pheasant in her lap, which her husband shot while hunting. Others suggest that space was reserved for a baby – the couple, who had nine children in total, had their first child only in 1751. If this was the intention, the portrait would celebrate Mr. Andrew’s authority as a landowner and husband. Mrs. Andrews died in 1780 at age 48, while her husband remarried and died in 1806 at age 80. 

The portrait was largely unknown to the public until it was displayed in an exhibition in Ipswich in 1927. After that, the painting regularly appeared in exhibitions across Britain and abroad. It remained with the family until 1960 when it was sold by Gerald Willoughbury Andrews (a great-great-great-grandson of the sitters). Today, the painting is in the National Gallery, London."
The Blue Boy,Gainsborough Thomas,Rococo,portrait,"One of the most celebrated British paintings is the portrait [i]The Blue Boy[/i] (c. 1770) by Thomas Gainsborough. The painting shows a boy dressed in a 17th-century costume, an homage to the Flemish master [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url]. The dress and gestures in [i]The Blue Boy[/i] echo van Dyck’s portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/charles-ii-as-child-1637][i]Charles II as a child[/i][/url] (1637), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/the-five-eldest-children-of-charles-i-1637][i]The Children of King Charles I of England[/i][/url] (1637) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck/portrait-of-charles-ii-when-prince-of-wales][i]Charles II as Prince of Wales, in Armor[/i][/url] (c. 1637-1638). These types of portraits were usually not commissions, instead, they served as intellectual exercises that allowed portrait painters to experiment, to show off their painterly skills and mastery. Gainsborough demonstrates his artistry in his treatment of the brooding landscape in the background, and the satin fabric costume in which he experiments with the play of light and shadow on the garment.

It has been said that Gainsborough painted [i]The Blue Boy[/i] because of his rivalry with fellow portrait painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joshua-reynolds]Sir Joshua Reynolds[/url]. In his writings, Reynolds stated that cool colors should not dominate the foreground, rather they should be used in small amounts to set off the warm colors in the painting. However, this story was likely invented to play up the rivalry between the painters: [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was exhibited in 1770, and Reynolds made this remark in 1778. Still, it is worth noting that the two painters held opposed artistic beliefs: while Reynolds was very stern and advocated for the study of old masters, Gainsborough was more spontaneous and modern in his approach. 

Because he was the owner of the painting, it was widely believed that the sitter in the painting was Jonathan Buttall, the son of a wealthy hardware merchant. However, this identification was never confirmed and recently art historian Susan Sloman suggested the sitter could be Gainsborough Dupont, the artist’s nephew. Dupont lived with Gainsborough’s family in Bath and London and was the painter’s one and only resident apprentice and assistant. Gainsborough painted his nephew’s portrait in a similar costume on two other occasions: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/dupont][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1770-1772) in the Tate collection and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-gainsborough/gainsborough-dupont-1773][i]Gainsborough Dupont[/i][/url] (1773) in the Rothschild collection. The two portraits of Dupont demonstrate a physical resemblance to the sitter in [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. In the Rothschild portrait, Dupont even wears a blue frock like the one worn by [i]The Blue Boy[/i]. Furthermore, x-rays of the painting show that originally Gainsborough painted a dog next to the boy. The dog, an English water spaniel was likely Tristram, one of the Gainsborough’s family pets, making it more likely that the artist was painting a family member.

The painting belonged to Jonathan Buttall until he filed for bankruptcy in 1796. From that point, it changed several owners: initially it was bought by politician John Nesbitt, later, in 1802, by painter John Hoppner, and in 1809, it entered the collection of Earl Grosvenor. During this period, [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was featured in multiple exhibitions: it became beloved by the public and was widely reproduced in print. In 1921, the iconic painting was sold to American railroad magnate Henry Edward Huntington for £182,200 – a record price at the time. The sale caused public outcry so before it was shipped to California, it was briefly displayed at The National Gallery. [i]The Blue Boy[/i] was seen by 90,000 people, and The National Gallery director Charles Holmes even made an emotional gesture by scrawling the words “Au Revoir, C.H” on the back of the canvas. Today, the painting is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California."
Giovanna Baccelli,Gainsborough Thomas,Rococo,portrait,"The portrait [i]Giovanna Baccelli[/i] (1782) exemplifies the artist’s mature style, which is characterized by his small and light brushstrokes. The subject of the portrait is Italian dancer Giovanna Baccelli, the principal ballerina at the King’s Theater, Haymarket. The pinnacle of her acclaimed career was during the 1780-1781season when she worked with the famous ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre and ballet dancer Gaetan Vestris. She also achieved great success performing in Venice in 1783-1784, and at the Paris Opera as late as 1788.

Baccelli was equally known for being the last and most enduring mistress of John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. The two lived a lavish lifestyle, and in 1779, the Duke set up Baccelli in Knole House in Sevenoaks, Kent. She also accompanied him to Paris when he was appointed Ambassador, and the pair were even admitted to the court of Queen Marie-Antoinette. With the outset of the French Revolution, they returned to Knole, where they stayed until they amicably parted ways in 1789. When Gainsborough exhibited Giovanna Baccelli at the Royal Academy in 1782, his other painting, a half-length portrait of the Duke was removed in order to preserve decorum. Baccelli’s talent also inspired Gainsborough’s contemporaries: she was the subject of portraits, lithographs, drawings, and sculptures by artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joshua-reynolds]Joshua Reynolds[/url], John Graham, John Boydell, and John Baptiste Locatelli.
Gainsborough painted Baccelli in the costume from her role in [i]Les Amans Supris[/i], a ballet by Louis Simonet that took London by storm in December 1780. He captures Baccelli mid-movement in a dancer pose: her slender foot is extended forward while she elegantly holds the edge of her skirt with her left hand. Through the costume and pose, Gainsborough emphasizes Baccelli’s role as a dancer, capturing the poise and grace she brought to the stage. In preparation for the portrait, Gainsborough created a small oil sketch, that is now in the collection of Sir Alfred Beit at Russborough House. There are several differences between the sketch and the full-length portrait. In the sketch, there is no tambourine, and the trees in the background are much lower. Gainsborough raised the trees in the final version to surround the dancer’s arm, thus drawing more attention to her expression.

In this mature phase of his career, Gainsborough was interested in different approaches for capturing movement and the effects of light and space. In [i]Giovanna Baccelli[/i], the artist experimented with new ways of depicting a figure in a natural setting. He created a harmonious color scheme, as the blue, pink, and white tones of Baccelli’s dress echo in the colors of the sky and landscape. The painting is one of the finest examples of Gainsborough’s mature portrait style: not only he captures the likeness of his subject but also demonstrates his masterly brushwork of small, quick, and light strokes. Through the delicate brushwork, the artist creates the illusion of movement, that injects liveliness into the portrait. The portrait was praised by critics, and one commented that it was ‘original, light airy and elegant’ like Baccelli herself."
Seashore with Fishermen,Gainsborough Thomas,Rococo,marina,"Born in rural Suffolk, the largely self-taught Gainsborough established his reputation as a society portraitist at Bath, a popular resort, before moving to London in 1774. Despite his urban success, he never lost his love of the countryside and coastline, lamenting, ""I'm sick of portraits and wish very much to ... walk off to some sweet village, where I can paint Landskips.""

Gainsborough's landscapes, however, are seldom if ever of actual scenery. In accordance with much eighteenth-century art theory, he believed that nature itself was an unsuitable subject. Only after an artist had refined a scene through his sensibilities could he begin to paint it.

In the 1780s, Gainsborough experimented with a ""peep-show box."" Using translucent paints, he created landscapes on sheets of glass that were then inserted into a shadow box. Backlit with candles, the miniature theatre permitted endless lighting schemes by means of changeable screens of colored silk. Depicting an imaginary seacoast, this canvas reveals the influence of Gainsborough's viewing box. Framed by the dark beach and pale cliff, the sky and surf seem phosphorescent.

As usual, Gainsborough improvised as he worked. The boulder in the lower-right corner conceals two fishermen and an anchor that he later painted out."
Mr. and Mrs. William Hallett (The Morning Walk),Gainsborough Thomas,Rococo,portrait,"[i]Mr. and Mrs. William Hallett[/i] (1785) also known as [i]The Morning Walk[/i] is a double full-length portrait of William Hallett and Elizabeth Stephen, painted ahead of their wedding on July 30, 1785. The handsome young couple is seen arm-in-arm strolling on their morning walk with a Pomeranian sheepdog. They are dressed in elegant frocks, possibly their wedding clothes. This type of portrait, which presented the sitters in a natural setting dressed up in their finest garments, was fashionable among wealthy patrons in the late 18th century. Such paintings were a powerful status symbol, signifying the couple’s wealth and social status. 

In terms of style, Gainsborough drew inspiration from the works of his predecessors,  [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antoine-watteau]Jean-Antoine Watteau[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anthony-van-dyck]Anthony van Dyck[/url]. The painting is characterized by Gainsborough’s light feathery brushwork, which was typical of his late style. This is most visible in the treatment of Mrs. Hallett’s dress and the dog’s thick soft coat. The artist creates a sense of lightness and movement, his slanting brushstrokes in the sky and foliage give the impression of a light breeze. Similarly, Elizabeth’s gauzy shawl and her husband’s hair almost blend into the landscape as the pair walks through. In this way, Gainsborough gave the portrait a delicate, poetic quality, which is described sometimes as a ‘lingering fragrance’. The painting was interpreted by some as a universal statement about wedding bliss, showing a young couple as they set out on their life journey together.

William Hallett was the grandson of a wealthy cabinet market. After the death of his grandfather in 1781, he inherited his villa and estate at Canons and Middlesex. Like many upper-class young men of the era, he went on the Grand Tour, traveling for two years through Europe. Upon his return, he married Elizabeth Stephen, the daughter of James Stephen, a wealthy surgeon who died before her marriage. Both the bride and groom were 21 when they got married at the richly decorated church of St Lawrence, Little Stanmore. The couple had six children in total, two sons and four daughters. In his will, William wrote that he lived with his wife Elizabeth ‘most happily for nearly 48 years, as it was impossible to do otherwise with such a woman’.

Nevertheless, Elizabeth’s life was probably a difficult one as her husband had a gambling problem which ultimately led to his downfall. By 1830, William’s habit of betting on horses and his poor business choices had caught up with him, and his entire fortune was squandered. Elizabeth died at the age of 69, and shortly after William remarried. According to his will, William had lost most of his fortune and had little to leave to his children. However, in the will he mentions a painting: ‘my picture of my late wife… painted before I married July 30th, 1785’, most likely Gainsborough’s painting, that he gave to his daughter Lettice Elizabeth.

For the last 60 years, [i]Mr. and Mrs. William Hallett[/i] has been part of the National Gallery collection in London. In 2017, a man attacked the painting with a screwdriver, making two large scratches on the canvas. Fortunately, the damage was not extensive, and the painting was restored and rehung in the Museum within 10 days."
Dormition of the Virgin,El Greco,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"One of El Greco’s earlier works, The Dormition of the Virgin was not attributed to him until 1983, when his signature was discovered at the bottom of the painting. This discovery led to the attribution of more of his earlier works, including Modena Triptych and Adoration of the Magi. The discovery of this piece as an El Greco painting has led to insights on his artistic style and subject matter. Painted in the Byzantine manner, this painting suggests that the artist changed his painting style in order to fit the subject matter and other requirements of the painting, including the desired location."
The Disrobing of Christ,El Greco,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"The Disrobing of Christ, otherwise known as El Espolio, was commissioned for the High Altar of the sacristy of the Cathedral of Toledo, in which it still resides today. El Greco secured the commission due to his friendship with Luis, the son of the Dean of the Cathedral, Diego de Castilla, who also commissioned his other great religious work, the paintings for the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, in Toledo. El Greco worked on both paintings simultaneously. Upon delivery, the church officials did not agree with some of the elements of the painting, including the addition of the three Marys in the foreground and that fact that Christ’s executioners are above him in the composition. This led to a legal dispute over the price of the painting, for which El Greco only received 350 out of the 950 ducats he was promised."
The Burial of the Count of Orgaz,El Greco,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"The Burial of the Count of Orgas is widely considered one of El Greco’s masterpieces. The painting depicts a popular legend, regarding the Count of Orgas, who was a pious man, and who upon his death left a large sum of money to the church. The legend tells that Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine descended from heaven at his funeral and buried them with their own hands. Andres Nunes, the parish priest of Sao Tome, was the commissioner of the work, who intended it for a project to refurbish the Count’s burial chapel. According to the commission, the observers of the burial were to be portraits of the notable men of Toledo at the time. The successful inclusion of a gallery of portraits of prominent men secured its esteem, and helps to rank El Greco as a master of his time."
View of Toledo,El Greco,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),"cityscape, landscape","One of only two surviving landscapes by El Greco, View of Toledo is among the best known depictions of the sky in western art. At the time it was painted, it was rare to portray an isolated landscape scene, making El Greco the first landscape artist in the history of Spanish art. It is not a true representation of the landscape of Toledo, however. Although the castle is in the correct place, the rest of the buildings are not truly represented in location or distance to each other. The painting is specifically mentioned in the movie “V for Vendetta,” in which the main character Evey Hammond directs her captor’s eyes toward the painting."
Opening of the fifth seal (The vision of Saint John the Divine),El Greco,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"The painting, unfinished at El Greco's death and listed in a postmortem inventory, depicts a passage in Revelation (6:9–11) describing the opening of the Fifth Seal and the distribution of white robes to ""those who had been slain for the work of God and for the witness they had borne."" It is cut down from a large altarpiece commissioned in 1608 for the church of the hospital of Saint John the Baptist in Toledo. The missing upper part may have shown the Sacrificial Lamb opening the Fifth Seal.

The broad open brushwork is characteristic of El Greco's late style. The picture is much damaged. Much admired by twentieth-century artists, the picture was studied in Paris by Picasso when he was working on ""Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"" and it was sketched by Jackson Pollock."
The Desperate Man (Self-Portrait),Courbet Gustave,Romanticism,self-portrait,"Many of Courbet’s early paintings from the 1840’s are self-portraits, such as this one. As he had yet to truly develop his realistic painting style, many of these self-portraits are Romantic in style, illustrating the smooth lines and perfection of form of the Romantic school of painting. As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840’s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters."
A Burial at Ornans,Courbet Gustave,Realism,genre painting,"This painting depicts the burial of Courbet’s great uncle in the small French town of Ornans, and it is considered to be one of the turning points in French art. The painting depicted the scene with an unflattering air, and it did not romanticize the depictions of grief and mourning, as in traditional Romantic paintings. Critics of the piece decried both the style of the painting as well as the size. At 10 feet tall by 22 feet wide, the size of the canvas was typically reserved for religious or heroic scenes, and the painting critics said was intentionally ugly and harsh. For the subjects in the painting, Courbet also used the real people who had actually been at the burial, rather than actors used as models for the art. As it had such a deleterious effect on the Romantic style of painting, it could also be easily called “The Burial of Romanticism,” as Courbet himself said: “The Burial at Ornans was in reality the burial of Romanticism.”

This 22 foot long canvas situated in a main room at the Musee d'Orsay buries the viewer as if he or she were in a cave. In a decidedly non-classical composition, figures mill about in the darkness, unfocused on ceremony. As a prime example of Realism, the painting sticks to the facts of a real burial and avoids amplified spiritual connotations. Emphasizing the temporal nature of life, Courbet intentionally did not let the light in the painting express the eternal. While sunset could have expressed the great transition of the soul from the temporal to the eternal, Courbet covered the evening sky with clouds so the passage of day into night is just a simple echo of the coffin passing from light into the dark of the ground. Some critics saw the adherence to the strict facts of death as slighting religion and criticized it as a shabbily composed structure with worn-faced working folk raised up to life-size in a gigantic work as if they had some kind of noble importance. Other critics such as Proudhon loved the inference of equality and virtue of all people and recognized how such a painting could help turn the course of Western art and politics."
The Bathers,Courbet Gustave,Realism,"genre painting, nude painting (nu)","This artwork is a prime example of Courbet's unconventional approach to depicting nudes. In this painting, which stands at an impressive eight feet tall, two women are depicted in a partially nude state without any mythical or rhetorical justification. Their figures are portrayed realistically, without idealization. Upon its initial unveiling, the artwork was met with harsh criticism, with Delacroix condemning the ""naked and overweight bourgeoisie... buttocks, and meaningless gestures."" However, instead of being detrimental, this negative attention actually garnered positive publicity for the painting, and despite the criticisms, Courbet was able to sell the work."
The Meeting (Bonjour Monsieur Courbet),Courbet Gustave,Realism,genre painting,"In this expansive artwork, Courbet depicts his meeting with Alfred Bruyas, a significant patron and supporter of the artist. The painting conveys the collector's admiration for Courbet's talent. The servant, as an extension of Bruyas, is captured in a gesture of utmost respect, but the key focal point is the moment of mutual appreciation shared between the artist and patron. Courbet's elevated status as a figure of great intellect and importance is highlighted by his slight backward tilt of the head and his position standing directly in the unfiltered light.

However, at the same time, Courbet's sense of self-importance is also evident in the painting. His beard points towards the patron as if in judgment, while the artist's stick is double the size of Bruyas', alluding to the artist's strength and dominance."
The Wheat Sifters,Courbet Gustave,Realism,genre painting,"The Wheat Sifters is an example of the simple realism that Courbet used in his work. Unlike paintings in the Romantic style, this painting does not employ perfection of line and form. It instead illustrates the unclean walls, bored look on the face of the laying woman, and the disheveled hair of the curious boy. As Courbet used actual figures for his paintings, it is said that the two women in the painting are his two sisters Zoe and Juliet, and the boy is actually his illegitimate son, Desire Binet. It was first exhibited in 1855 at the Salon of Paris, and later in 1861, when it was purchased for the Musee des Beaux-Arts of Nantes."
The Artist’s Studio,Courbet Gustave,Realism,allegorical painting,"The Artist’s Studio, or A Real Allegory of a Seven Year Phase in May Artistic and Moral Life, was completed in a mere six weeks. All of the figures in the painting are allegorical representations of the figures that Courbet depicted in his paintings, and are all collected in his art studio for him to paint. The figures include people from all levels of society, including his friends and acquaintances, a nude representing the academic tradition of art, a child, and a dog, all the while Courbet is painting a landscape scene. In 1855, Courbet presented the painting to be displayed at the Paris World Fair, but it was refused entrance due to space concerns (the canvas was roughly 11 feet by 20 feet). Courbet thus took forty of his paintings and displayed them alongside the gallery in his own exhibition.  

This 19 foot long painting is an expression of Courbet's self-love and pride in his iron will, hard work and revolutionary genius. Just as he heroicized others in the Burial at Ornans, he does the same for himself in this work. With a good measure of egotism, Courbet expresses that things get done and attitudes change when people think for themselves and challenge the status quo. Courbet places himself full-size, brush in hand, working on a landscape picture. His friends on the right are emblematic of kindred spirits and innovation, while the admiring boy is an expression of Courbet's confidence that his legacy will transcend generations. The nude model standing behind the artist affirms his greatness and her role as muse. To the left stand the working poor, Courbet's recognition of their right to be included. His nemesis, Napoleon III, is presented as a poacher holding a firearm, accompanied by his dogs. Courbet's chin-up gaze trumps Napoleon's downward tipped head in an expression of the innovator dominating over the authoritarian."
The Sleepers,Courbet Gustave,Realism,nude painting (nu),"This work shows Courbet's interest in an erotic Realism that became prevalent in his later work. Raw eroticism is delivered without aid of cupids or mythological justification of any kind, making this work vulgar to those with the prevailing taste of the day. Such unsanctified nudes provoked much discussion about flaws in Courbet's character and art, but the artist reveled in the added attention and increased reputation as a confrontational artist.
In the 1860’s Courbet began painting erotic nudes scenes, including depictions of female genitalia, nude women in erotic poses, and this painting, depicting lesbianism. Courbet gained much notoriety for his erotic nudes, which he displayed alongside hunting scenes, ensuring a sales and a reputation. Le Sommeil was commissioned by the Turkish diplomat Khalil Bey, who also commissioned The Origin of the World, to include his private collection of erotic paintings. This particular painting was also part of a police report in 1872 when a painting dealer held in it an exhibition. It was not allowed to be displayed publicly until 1988."
The Death of the Deer,Courbet Gustave,Realism,genre painting,"It was exhibited at The Salon in 1869 (not the painting's date).  It may return to Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besançon (currently under renovation, expected completion: 2017)."
The Wave,Courbet Gustave,Realism,landscape,"Many early Modernists were influenced by Japanese prints and it is argued that Courbet is one of the first to be affected by this Eastern aesthetic. Likely, taking a cue from the prints, he shows us a slice of water closed off from the view of vast space. The painting epitomizes Courbet's landscapes and seascapes that were always composed of broken patches of paint loaded in both the dark and light areas. Such painterly treatment was inspiration to the budding Impressionists."
The Wave,Courbet Gustave,Realism,landscape,"The influence of Japanese prints on many early Modernists, including Courbet, is well-documented. In fact, some argue that Courbet was among the first artists to be impacted by this Eastern aesthetic. Inspired by the prints, he portrays a portion of water enclosed from the view of vast space. This painting is a prime example of Courbet's landscapes and seascapes, which consist of fragmented patches of paint applied in both the dark and light areas. This technique served as inspiration for the budding Impressionists."
The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit,Sargent John Singer,Realism,portrait,"This early piece exemplifies the influence of the Old Masters on Sargent's style. The artist utilizes the atypical square format employed by Diego Velázquez in Las Meninas (1656) and adopts the Spanish painter's approach of capturing the natural essence of his subjects to convey their personalities.

The arrangement of the figures deviates from the conventional group portrait where each individual holds an equal standing. Instead, the girls are positioned seemingly at random throughout the dimly lit, ornately furnished room, surrounded by two large blue and white porcelain vases. Three of the four girls gaze directly at the viewer, while the fourth faces her sister, who wears a matching black and white outfit. The youngest daughter (Julia, aged 4) sits informally on the floor, in stark contrast to the older girls who stand stiffly behind her. The two eldest sisters (Jane, 12, and Florence, 14) are partially obscured in shadow as they stand in the doorway leading to another room. Several critics have observed that the painting transcends its function as a group portrait to symbolize the loss of innocence associated with growing up. Sargent's depiction suggests how people often conceal their true selves behind a façade of manners and etiquette, evoking the restrictive social norms that upper-class women of the time were raised under."
El Jaleo,Sargent John Singer,Realism,genre painting,"The painting [i]El Jaleo[/i] (1882) by John Singer Sargent made the artist’s reputation when it was first exhibited at the 1882 Paris Salon. The enormous canvas (237x352 cm) that depicts a flamenco performance became an overnight sensation with French audiences and critics. 

The painting is an example of Hispanism, an intricate 19th-century phenomenon in Europe and the United States that refers to a widespread fascination with everything related to Spanish culture. Hispanism had a pervasive influence in different fields. Some famous examples include literary works by Theophile Gautier and Washington Irving, and George Bizet’s opera [i]Carmen[/i] that premiered in Paris in 1875. However, for Sargent, who spent the autumn of 1879 in Spain, the subject of flamenco was more than a fashion choice. The trip to Spain was a formative experience: he copied works of old Spanish masters at the Prado Museum and made live sketches of folk dancers. While traveling through Southern Spain, he observed flamenco performances and became particularly fond of Andalusian Gypsy music. Thus, the choice of subject for [i]El Jaleo[/i] was likely a combination of the growing market for exotic imagery and the artist’s admiration for Spanish music and dance. 

The title [i]El Jaleo[/i] refers to the uproar during the performance, when the audience encourages the dancers by clapping and chanting over the guitar music. The artist painted [i]El Jaleo[/i] three years after his trip to Spain in a studio in France with the help of professional models, costumes and props. Even though Sargent's models were neither dancers nor Spaniards, the artist used his memories and knowledge of flamenco to capture an authentic atmosphere of dynamic performance. In this painting, the arrangement of figures conforms to the traditional presentation of flamenco. The performance is set on a small stage, and the dancer has other performers behind her in a line or a semicircle, leaving her little room to move. This setting also allows the musicians to follow the tempo set by the dancer as they play the accompanying music. 

In producing [i]El Jaleo[/i] Sargent worked methodically to achieve the spontaneity and drama of flamenco. He created many sketches and also the preparatory painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-spanish-dancer-study-for-el-jaleo-1882][i]Spanish Dancer[/i][/url] (1882). The dancer’s contorted pose is one of the most complex elements, that demonstrates the mastery of the flamenco technique and style. In the same way, the sketch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/head-and-hands-of-seated-musicians-study-for-el-jaleo-1880][i]Head and hands of seated musicians[/i][/url] (1888) is part of the preliminary studies for the singer on the dancer’s right.  The singer is caught amid a moving performance with his mouth wide open and his head thrown back. 

After the Salon in Paris, [i]El Jaleo[/i] was sold to Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, a retired American diplomat. In 1914, Coolidge gave the painting to his good friend Isabella Stewart Gardner - a leading American art collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts. The painting was the centerpiece of the music room at the Gardener home in Boston, and today it remains in the city hanging at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum."
Madame X (also known as Madame Pierre Gautreau),Sargent John Singer,Realism,portrait,"[i]Madame X[/i] (1883-1884) by John Singer Sargent caused a great deal of scandal when it was first exhibited at the 1884 Paris Salon. Even though the painting was named Madame *** (later changed to Madame X), the subject was easily recognizable as the young socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau. Unlike most of Sargent's portraits, [i]Madame X[/i] was not a commission: the artist sought out Gautreau and asked to paint her. 

Gautreau was an unconventional beauty known for lavender powdered skin and a highly stylized appearance. Sargent believed she was a great charmer and a subject worthy of grand portrait that would excite Parisian art circles. Both American expatriates, the two had overlapping ambitions as they were establishing themselves in Parisian high society. Gautreau was encouraged by her mother to accept Sargent’s offer. In June 1883 the artist traveled to Gautreau’s estate in Brittany to execute [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/madame-gautreau-1883]preliminary studies and sketches[/url] for the portrait. Depicting Gautreau’s painted skin was a challenge for Sargent; he struggled at times to capture the artificial blue and lavender tones of her complexion. At one point, Sargent became so frustrated with his unsuccessful attempts that he decided to start a new portrait, leaving the unfinished version [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/study-of-mme-gautreau-1884][i]Study of Madame Gautreau[/i][/url] (Madame X) (ca. 1884). 

All parties were anticipating success and were unprepared for the devastating outcome: the painting received more ridicule than praise, and it was panned for being a distasteful display of vanity. For the salon audience, the artwork was too brazen: Gautreau's pose is sensual and suggestive, and her presentation is lavish and extravagant. She wears a sumptuous satin gown, a black dress that stands in contrast to her artificially pale skin. Gautreau was known for her bold use of makeup, which was still uncommon among French upper classes. Women were encouraged to use cosmetics moderately to achieve a ‘natural look’ with slightly colored cheeks and lips or thickened eyebrows and eyelashes. 

Sargent defended his work vigorously saying his depiction was accurate to reality and his sitter’s appearance. He resisted the negative criticism, which prompted Gautreau’s mother to beg him to take the painting down. Even though [i]Madame X[/i] remained at the Salon, Sargent did make one amendment. When the portrait was first presented the right shoulder strap on Madame X’s dress falls off the side, an element that contributed to the suggestive and sexual nature of the painting. Sargent repainted the shoulder strap but resisted pressures to make any further changes. 

Gautreau was publically humiliated and mocked for her American crudeness. Later, her beauty was captured by other artists in portraits like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/antonio-de-la-gandara/portrait-of-mme-pierre-gaudreau-1898][i]Madame Pierre Gautreau[/i][/url] (1898) by Antonio de La Gándara and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-claude-etienne-courtois/madame-gautreau-1891][i]Madame Gautreau[/i][/url] (1891) by Gustave Courtois. Sargent was also humiliated: critics compared [i]Madame X[/i] to a plastic idol or ghost. After the Salon Sargent left Paris and moved to London, where he continued to build his career. [i]Madame X[/i] remained in Sargent’s possession until 1916, when the artist finally sold the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sargent remarked that the portrait was probably the best work he ever produced."
Claude Monet Painting by the Edge of a Wood,Sargent John Singer,Impressionism,portrait,"Sargent's experimentation with different media and styles is evident in this painting, despite the fact that his watercolor work is usually associated with his later career when he was established as the top portraitist of the elite. Sargent's friendship with Monet developed during his student days at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and he visited Monet's home in Giverny multiple times during the 1880s. In this painting, Sargent employs Monet's en plein air technique to depict his friend painting nature directly outdoors, with Monet's wife Alice sitting patiently in the background.

While the image on Monet's easel shows a sky scene, Sargent focuses more on the two figures and the interplay of light on the grass and trees. This impressionistic style is quite different from Sargent's more realistic approach to portraiture. Nevertheless, the painting's exploration of the relationship between Monet and Alice exemplifies Sargent's strength as an artist, that of capturing the dynamics of human relationships in his works."
"Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose",Sargent John Singer,Impressionism,genre painting,"[i]Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose[/i] (1885-1886) by John Singer Sargent was painted en [i]plein air[/i] - a French term for ‘painting outdoors.’ This method of painting was particularly important to 19th-century art movements such as the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/hudson-river-school]Hudson River School[/url], the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/barbizon-school]Barbizon School[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionism[/url]. 

The inspiration for the unique lighting effect came during an 1885 boating trip Sargent took with fellow painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edwin-austin-abbey]Edwin Austin Abbey[/url]. On one evening, near the Thames at Pangbourne, he saw Chinese lanterns hanging from trees spreading light over beds of flowers. After Pangbourne, Sargent stayed with artist Francis David Millet at Farm House in Broadway, Worcestershire; and there he began working on the painting. Sargent’s progress was slow; he worked on the painting from September 1885 and completed it sometime in October 1886. It was because Sargent was determined to recreate the light effect from Pangbourne, and painted only a few minutes every evening to capture the same level of light at dusk. 

The painting depicts two children lighting Chinese lanterns in a garden. The painting is set in the garden of the Cotswolds village of Broadway, and the models were Dolly and Polly Barnard, the daughters of Sargent’s friend, illustrator Frederick Bernard. He chose Dolly and Polly, who were 11 and 7 years old, because their light blonde hair complemented the color scheme. Sargent produced sketches and studies like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/dorothy-barnard-1885][i]Dorothy Barnard[/i][/url] (1885-1886) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/study-of-polly-barnard-for-carnation-lily-lily-rose][i]Polly Barnard[/i][/url] (1885-1886) to capture them in their natural poses when painting. Each evening Sargent would prepare his easel and paints, and pose the girls ahead of time to catch the perfect light before it quickly disappeared. As autumn came, the flowers died, and Sargent had to replace them with artificial flowers. One of Sargent’s main preoccupations with the painting was the composition, and he gradually cut two feet off from the left side of the canvas. By doing this, Sargent created an almost square format that resulted in a more concentrated composition. 

The title of the painting came from “[i]The Wreath[/i],” an 18th-century song by opera composer Joseph Mazzinghi. The chorus of the songs has the lines: “[i]Tell me have you seen my Flora pass this way? A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose[/i]”. The song possibly relates to the ambiance at Broadway, where Sargent and his friends would spend their evenings singing around the piano. 

The painting was first exhibited in 1887 at the Royal Academy exhibition, where it received praise from audiences and critics. In 1887, [i]Tate Gallery[/i] purchased the painting, an acquisition that was supported by influential figures such as the Royal Academy President [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frederic-leighton]Sir Frederic Leighton[/url]. The painting is part of the Tate collection and is displayed at [i]Tate Britain[/i] in London."
Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth,Sargent John Singer,Realism,portrait,"The famed Shakespearean actress Dame Alice Ellen Terry is the subject of John Singer Sargent’s portrait [i]Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth[/i] (1889). Terry came from a family of well-known actors and became the leading Shakespearean actress in Britain. From 1878, she became the leading lady of the Henry Irving company, and over the next two decades, she and Irving achieved great success touring in Britain and the United States. 

The painting shows Terry in her famous role of Lady Macbeth that she played in Irving’s production of Macbeth at the Lyceum Theatre in London. Sargent saw the first performance on December 29, 1888, and was immediately drawn to the actress’s costume and performance. Even though Terry was hesitant to sit for the artist until she was more certain of the play's success, it seems she began posing for the portrait shortly after their initial encounter. This is confirmed by Sargent in a letter he wrote on January 1, 1889, where he mentioned the poor lighting that slowed down his progress. 

The pose in the painting was Sargent’s innovation: Lady Macbeth holds up the royal crown that she is about to place on her head. This scene does not appear in the play, and there is no evidence that the dramatic pose was part of Irving’s production of Macbeth. The pose is indicative of Lady Macbeth’s intoxication with power, and Terry’s expressive qualities as an actress: her eyes are glazed and ecstatic, she is not a symbol of moderation and innocence associated with Victorian womanhood but an icon of decadence. Terry wore her Lady Macbeth costume, a gown designed by Alice Comyns Carr and made by Ada Nettleship. The lavish dress was embroidered in gold and decorated with 1,000 iridescent wings of green jewel beetles, as well as diamonds and rubies. Terry with her luscious red braids and brilliant green and blue garment resembles a queen in a Celtic legend. This was not the only time Sargent painted Terry: the grisaille sketch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/ellen-terry-as-lady-macbeth-1906][i]Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth[/i] (1906)[/url], shows Lady Macbeth waiting to greet Duncan. Sargent created this drawing for Ellen Terry Jubilee Program in 1906. 

Ellen Terry mentioned the 1889 portrait in her Memories recalling that it was the sensation of the year. The famous author, Oscar Wilde who observed Sargent and Terry’s collaboration, wrote about Terry posing for Sargent: [i]“The street that on a wet and dreary morning has vouchsafed the vision of Lady Macbeth in full regalia magnificently seated in a four-wheeler can never again be as other streets: it must always be full of other possibilities.”[/i] Terry also wrote that before Sargent finished the portrait, the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-burne-jones]Edward Burne-Jones[/url] suggested slight alterations to the coloring which Sargent accepted. Irving bought [i]Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth[/i] for the Beefsteak Room at the Lyceum Theatre, where it hung in an alcove. After Irving’s death in 1905, the painting was bought by Sir Joseph Joel Duveen, who donated it to the Tate Gallery in 1906."
"Mrs. Carl Meyer, later Lady Meyer, and her two Children",Sargent John Singer,Realism,portrait,"This painting exemplifies the commissioned portraits of the wealthy upper class that brought Sargent his fame. It depicts Baronet Meyer, a British banker and diamond miner with connections to the Rothschild family and the De Beers group, along with his son Frank and daughter Elsie. By commissioning portraits from accomplished artists like Sargent, wealthy plutocrats like Meyer used their talent to showcase their wealth and social status in elite circles.

The opulent furniture and the family's attire are reminiscent of 18th-century British high society. The gilt sofa and Mrs. Meyer's heavy, iridescent rose silk gown exude the lavishness of Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles. Sargent intentionally surrounded Mrs. Meyer with luxurious objects to emphasize her status as a member of the London elite. Following the example of the most successful Old Master portraitists, such as Van Dyck, Sargent used flattering details to highlight the sitter's best features. Placed front and center, Mrs. Meyer dominates the composition, while her children are mostly hidden behind the couch, suggesting something about their familial dynamic. Mrs. Meyer's priority is clearly to highlight her own glamour and opulence, rather than to draw attention to her children."
Bedouins,Sargent John Singer,Impressionism,portrait,"During his travels from September 1905 to January 1906, Sargent journeyed through the Ottoman Levant, exploring Jerusalem, Syria, and Beirut. Sargent had been fascinated by the region for some time and had previously read extensively about its history and culture. He was likely influenced by his acquaintance with Gertrude Bell, an academic expert in Levantine archeology and Arab culture. While traveling on horseback, Sargent visited Bedouin camps in the Jordan Valley and drew inspiration from this journey for his extensive mural cycle, Triumph of Religion (1895-1916), at the Boston Public Library.

This painting captures the same realistic nuance and detail for which Sargent's portraits were known, though a more impressionistic style is evident in the treatment of the surroundings and the men's clothing. The painting features a warm color palette of saturated indigo blues, warm browns, and fuchsia tones. The men's head scarves are highlighted with white gouache, capturing the intense heat of the desert during midday."
Gassed,Sargent John Singer,Realism,genre painting,"[i]Gassed[/i] (1919) by John Singer Sargent depicts the aftermath of a mustard gas attack on the Western Front in August 1918. This is a unique painting in Sargent’s body of work, who is best known for fashionable portraits, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/lady-agnew-of-lochnaw][i]Lady Agnew of Lochnaw[/i][/url] (1892) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/the-wyndham-sisters-1899][i]The Wyndham Sisters: Lady Elcho, Mrs. Adeane, and Mrs. Tennant[/i][/url] (1899). In May 1918, Sargent was commissioned by the British government to create a large painting for the Hall of Remembrance for World War I. As an American painter, Sargent was asked to create a painting that represented the idea of Anglo-American cooperation. In 1918, Sargent traveled to France with fellow artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henry-tonks]Henry Tonks[/url] to observe the troops on the Western Front, visiting the Guards Division at Bavincourt and the American Division at Ypres. Sargent struggled to find a suitable subject for the painting, he wanted to paint an epic showing masses of men, but could not find a scene that featured many British and American soldiers. Sargent considered several ideas before deciding to paint the aftermath of the mustard gas attack he witnessed while in France. He described the incident in a letter to biographer Evan Charteris as  [i]‘one harrowing sight, a field full of gassed and blindfolded men’[/i]. 

[i]Gassed[/i], a painting of a heroic scale (231x611 cm) shows several lines of wounded soldiers moving toward the dressing station. The scene is dark and tragic: the soldiers blinded by the gas have their eyes bandaged, they hold onto each other as medical orderlies assist them. All around them are bodies of wounded and dead piled on top of one another. 

Sargent exposes the reality of war and the horrific impact of chemical weapons, his heroes are helpless and broken men, whose fates are a mystery - will they recover or see again, will they even survive? There is also activity in the background, biplanes flying through the sky and a group of soldiers playing football. Sargent’s painting examines the harsh realities of war: the poor conditions and equipment of the troops and the human suffering caused by the gas attack. The ongoing football match indicates how these horrors have become a constant presence that no longer interrupts the daily routine.

Sargent painting draws on the tradition of heroic paintings: the composition was inspired by the triptych [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello/the-battle-of-san-romano-1440][i]The Battle of San Romano[/i][/url] (ca.1435-1460) by Florentine painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-uccello]Paolo Uccello[/url]. Some have also suggested that the central group of figures was inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder]Pieter Bruegel[/url]’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pieter-bruegel-the-elder/parable-of-the-blind-1568][i]The Parable of the Blind[/i][/url] (1568) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/auguste-rodin]Auguste Rodin[/url]’s sculpture [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/auguste-rodin/burghers-of-calais][i]The Burghers of Calais[/i][/url] (1884-1889). [i]Gassed[/i] was first exhibited in 1919 at the Royal Academy in London, and it was voted picture of the year by the Royal Academy of Arts. Although the painting received high praise from Winston Churchill, it also had some notable critics. The novelists E.M. Forster and Virginia Woolf both criticized [i]Gassed[/i] for being naively patriotic. Today the painting belongs to the collection of the Imperial War Museum in London."
Self-Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight,Durer Albrecht,Northern Renaissance,self-portrait,"The genre of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/self-portrait#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]self-portraiture[/url] fully developed in Western painting during the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Renaissance[/url]. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Dürer’s self-portraits[/url] are not only among the earliest examples of the genre, but are also some of the finest works of self-portraiture ever produced in Western art.  [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] (1500) is particularly significant; it is an artistic proclamation that is deeply tied to how Durer wanted to position himself in the context of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/northern-renaissance#!#filterName:Genre_self-portrait,resultType:masonry]Northern Renaissance[/url] and the Humanist movement.

The self-portrait gave Dürer the opportunity to display the breadth of his technical skill, particularly in creating the textures of his luscious hair and rich fur. It is likely that the portrait remained in Dürer’s cabinet, exhibited in private viewings to impress prospective clients and used for demonstrations to his students. In the self-portrait, the artist adorns a fashionable brown coat with a fur trim, a garment worn by 15th century noblemen. The garment is a symbol of social status, and indicates Dürer’s climb on the social ladder. This also represents the new status of artists in the Renaissance, where they were elevated from anonymity, and recognized publicly as creators and not mere craftsmen. The self-portrait is accompanied by the inscription: [i]“I, Albrecht Durer of Nuremberg painted myself thus, with undying colors, at the age of twenty eight years”[/i]. In the Medieval era, the age twenty eight signified the transition to maturity. The inscription plays up this symbolism, signifying the artist entering a new era.

The frontal portrait is highly unusual for a secular portrait. It deliberately invites the comparison to the image of Christ, particularly to the iconography of Christ as [i]Salvator Mundi[/i] (Savior of the World). The self-portrait evokes the concept of [i]Imitatio Christi[/i], the ideal of imitating and following the Christ. It is possible that Dürer emphasized the biblical idea that Man was created in God’s image, and through the self-portrait he was asserting that his creativity originates in divine grace. However, Dürer’s use of religious iconography also expresses humanist values. The frontal portrait exemplifies symmetry and harmony, ideals praised by ancient writers such as Cicero and Vitruvius, and promoted by Italian Renaissance humanist Leon Battista Alberti. Dürer, and in particularly this self-portrait, were praised by German Renaissance humanist, Konrad Celtes. 

Dürer and Celtes, along with other German humanists were proponents of the Northern Renaissance, and had the ambition to bring forward a cultural Golden Age. In a text addressed to Dürer, Celtes links him to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/apelles]Apelles[/url], a renowned painter of Ancient Greece. Celtes called Dürer the “second Apelles”, and indeed in the self-portrait Dürer presents himself as a Christian Apelles. The dark and minimal color scheme of the self-portrait may have been inspired by Apelles, who was celebrated for his four color system of painting and his dark, glossy glaze. Therefore, [i]Self Portrait at the Age of Twenty Eight[/i] can be understood as an artistic statement, Dürer absorbing the praise of his contemporaries and reaffirming his position as the “new Apelles” of the Northern Renaissance."
Young Hare,Durer Albrecht,Northern Renaissance,animal painting,"The watercolor, [i]A Young Hare[/i] (1502), is one of the most famous examples of Dürer’s study of nature and animals. The artwork is significant, not only because it demonstrates Dürer’s supreme craftsmanship, but also because it provides insight into Dürer’s understanding of the relationship between art and nature. The [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance#!#resultType:masonry]Renaissance[/url] brought about the development of new techniques of representation, such as the study of proportions, perspective and imitation of nature. When visiting Italy in the late 1490s, Dürer got acquainted with many of these techniques and brought over the newly acquired knowledge back to Germany.  For this reason, much of Dürer’s artwork from the early 1500s, including [i]A Young Hare[/i], expressed his interest in nature.

The artist understood the importance of observing nature, stating: “Depart not from Nature… for Art is rooted in Nature, and whoever can pull it out, has it”. The quote shows Dürer’s position on the relation between art and nature, and how studying and emulating nature is crucial to artistic creation. Another central principal in Dürer’s perception of nature was diversity, meaning that every specimen and detail in nature has a distinctive character that should be captured. In other words, Dürer’s intention was not to create an archetypical form or rely purely on the general characteristics of an animal or plant. Dürer conceived the hare with exceptional virtuosity, paying attention to the minutest details, such as the hare’s whiskers and eyes. The artist captures its shy and fragile nature, showing great empathy and affection for the small animal. 

The method by which Dürer managed to reach this level of accuracy is a point of discussion. At this period, methods of animal stuffing were not yet existent, hence Dürer did not have an option of copying a stuffed model. Likely, Dürer created preparatory sketches of the animal in the wild, and relied on his memory to complete the watercolor. It is also possible that the artist studied a dead animal or caught a live animal and kept it in his workshop.

In this case, the subject of the hare is presented in a non religious and non symbolic context. This aligns with Dürer’s perception of nature and his pure interest in studying nature (animals, landscapes and plants). An interesting aspect of the watercolor is the background. Dürer chose to present the hare in a white space rather than its natural habitat, like a forest or meadow. The neutral background was used by Dürer repeatedly, in artworks such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/head-of-a-stag#!#resultType:masonry][i]Head of a Stag[/i][/url] (ca. 1503), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/the-little-owl-1506][i]The Little Owl[/i][/url] (1506) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/wing-of-a-blue-roller-1512][i]Wing of a Blue Roller[/i][/url] (1512). In the case of [i]A Young Hare[/i], some point out Dürer paints a reflection of a window in the hare’s eye, suggesting that the animal was drawn in the artist’s studio. Nevertheless, this is speculative because this technique was commonly used by Dürer. Many of Dürer’s successors and students copied the drawing, however they always placed the animal in a natural environment, such as a meadow or a forest. An example of this is [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-hoffmann/a-hare-in-the-forest-after-durer-1585][i]A Hare in the Forest[/i][/url] (ca. 1585) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hans-hoffmann]Hans Hoffmann[/url], who based this oil painting on Dürer’s watercolor."
Christ among the Doctors,Durer Albrecht,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"[i]Christ among the Doctors[/i] (1506) was executed by Albrecht Dürer during his second trip to Italy. The panel depicts an episode from the life of Christ - at age twelve, young Jesus goes along with Joseph and Mary on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Jesus lingers at the temple and is later found in discussion with the elders of the temple. The painting contains a Latin inscription, located on a page slip in the book held by the elder on the left: [i]Opus quinque dierum[/i], meaning “work executed in five days”. Scholars agree that this refers to the swift execution of the painting, which has a base of tempera and a thin coat of oil paint.

[i]Christ among the Doctors[/i] is not only distinct in the context of Dürer’s work, but also generally it resembles few other paintings from the period. The artist conceives an overcrowded and dense composition, dominated by a pattern of hands, heads and books. This density and lack of space is reminiscent of the late work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch]Hieronymus Bosch[/url] and his followers, in paintings such as: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/christ-crowned-with-thorns-1510][i]Christ Crowned with Thorns[/i][/url] (ca. 1510),[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/the-carrying-of-the-cross-1480] [i]Christ Carrying the Cross[/i][/url] (ca. 1510) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/hieronymus-bosch/christ-before-pilate-1516][i]Christ before Pontius Pilate[/i][/url] (ca. 1520). The painting is also relatively flat, which, given Dürer’s interest and knowledge of the art of perspective, should be understood as an intentional artistic choice. This is evident when comparing the painting to Dürer’s earlier depictions of the theme, in one of the panels of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/the-seven-sorrows][i]The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin[/i][/url] (1494-1497), and in the woodcut from the series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/all-works#!#filterName:Series_life-of-the-virgin,resultType:masonry][i]Life of the Virgin[/i][/url] (1503). In both instances, the artist depicts the figures in full within a spacious interior.

In [i]Christ among the Doctors[/i], Dürer successfully combines elements of Italian and Northern European painting. The composition was likely inspired by the Venetian type half-length picture. For example, Dürer’s painting is similar in arrangement to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cima-da-conegliano/christ-among-the-doctors-1504][i]Christ among the Doctor’s[/i][/url] (1504) by Italian Renaissance painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/cima-da-conegliano]Cima da Conegliano[/url]. However, the solemn and quiet mood of Cima’s painting is very different from the tense and dynamic atmosphere created by Dürer. Dürer builds a dramatic conflict by contrasting the youth and beauty of Christ with the ugliness and old age of the Jewish rabbis. The grotesque heads of the Jewish rabbis draw from the tradition of northern grotesque iconography. Here once again, Bosch is an important influence. In paintings such as the abovementioned [i]Christ Crowned with Thorns[/i], Christ’s enemies are modeled in a similar style. In addition, many have cited [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo Da Vinci[/url]’s drawings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/all-works#!#filterName:Genre_caricature,resultType:masonry]grotesque heads[/url] as a possible influence. 

In the painting, Dürer used variation to express ugliness and deformity, in order to introduce different symbols of evil. The two faces on the left fall under the category Durer called ‘[i]Bäurisch Gestalt[/i]’, which referred to brutish, peasant-like figures. The left upper figure’s eyes are covered by a hat, symbolizing the blindness of the Synagogue. The bearded figure in the forefront represents ugliness through the emphasis on old age. The central figure that touches Jesus introduces another type of ugliness, which is expressed through the abnormality of his features. Finally, the two figures in the background embody the idea of the ‘evil eye’, a type of evil that seems to possess a demonic power."
"The Knight, Death and the Devil",Durer Albrecht,Northern Renaissance,allegorical painting,"[i]Knight, Death and the Devil[/i] (1513), is one of Dürer’s most famous and most complex artworks that has been subject to much debate among art historians. At the heart of the controversy is the figure of the knight, and his symbolic function and meaning. Frequently, Dürer’s knight was interpreted as a symbol of moral virtue, an embodiment of the ideal of the ‘Christian Knight’. Following this interpretation the knight is a stoic figure, unfazed by the devil and the monsters that try to entice him. The knight is protected by his armor, and accompanied by his dog, a symbol of loyalty. Some have tied the conception of the engraving to the [i]Handbook of a Christian Knight[/i], written by the Dutch humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam. It was also suggested that the knight could have been modeled after several historical figures, including Martin Luther, Pope Julius II and Franz von Sickingen, a German knight and important figure of the early period of the Reformation.

However, more recent studies challenge the interpretation of the ‘Christian Knight’, pointing out that it overlooks the social and political context of Dürer’s time. Historical documentation refers to the phenomena of Robber Knights, who attacked and louted dealers and merchants, threatening trade and finances of cities such as Nuremberg (Dürer’s place of birth and principal place of residence). Evidence of Dürer’s contempt for these figures may exist in an earlier artwork, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/death-and-the-landsknecht-1510][i]Death and Landsknecht[/i][/url] (1510). In the 1510 woodcut, Death confronts the indifferent Knight, who appears unconcerned by the ominous encounter. The woodcut is accompanied by a poem written by the artist, in which he warns those who do not pay their dues in this life. If indeed the knight in [i]Knight, Death and the Devil[/i] is a ‘Robber Knight’, the devil and death are not his adversaries, but rather his companions. In this case, the knight could be seen as passive or compliant. The contrary interpretations of the knight also impact the analysis of other details in the engraving, such as the foxtail attached to the tip of the knight’s lance. In the context of the ‘Christian Knight’ interpretation, the foxtail can be seen as a good luck charm. In contrast, according to the ‘Robber Knight’ analysis, the foxtail can symbolize the trickery and the cunning nature of the fox.   

Another focal element in the engraving is the Knight’s horse, which was conceived with impressive anatomical accuracy. It is proposed that the pose of the knight and horse was inspired by Italian equestrian statues, particularly by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio]Andrea del Verrochio[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andrea-del-verrochio/equestrian-statue-of-bartolomeo-colleoni][i]Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni[/i][/url] (1480-1488), in Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. Because of his travels to Venice, Dürer was certainly familiar with the statue. Likewise, parallels can be made with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Leonardo Da Vinci[/url]’s preparatory [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci/study-for-the-sforza-monument-1489]drawings for the equestrian monument of Francesco Sforza[/url]. Another identified source of influence is Dürer’s contemporary, German Renaissance painter, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder]Lucas Cranach the Elder[/url]. Cranach’s woodcut, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/lucas-cranach-the-elder/knight-in-armor-riding-toward-the-right-1506][i]Knight in Armor Riding toward the Right[/i][/url] (1506), demonstrates similarities in the position of the horse, the gloomy figure of the knight and the elements in the backdrop, the castle on the hill. Therefore, Dürer seems to successfully adapt a variety of sources, the robust proportions of Italian equestrian statues together with northern influences, such as Cranach’s woodcut."
Melancholy I,Durer Albrecht,Northern Renaissance,allegorical painting,"Dürer's Melencolia I is one of three large prints of 1513 and 1514 known as his Meisterstiche (master engravings). The other two are [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/the-knight-death-and-the-devil-1513]Knight, Death, and the Devil[/url]  and [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/st-jerome-in-his-study-1514]Saint Jerome in His Study[/url]. The three are in no way a series, but they do correspond to the three kinds of virtue in medieval scholasticism--moral, theological, and intellectual--and they embody the complexity of Dürer's thought and that of his age.
Melencolia I is a depiction of the intellectual situation of the artist and is thus, by extension, a spiritual self-portrait of Dürer. In medieval philosophy each individual was thought to be dominated by one of the four humors; melancholy, associated with glack gall, was the least desirable of the four, and melancholics were considered the most likely to succumb to insanity. Renaissance thought, however, also linked melancholy with creative genius; thus, at the same time that this idea changed the status of this humor, it made the self-conscious artist aware that his gift came with terrible risks.
The winged personification of Melancholy, seated dejectedly with her head reasting on her hand, holds a caliper and is surrounded by other tools associated with geometry, the one of the seven liberal arts that underlies artistic creation--and the one through which Dürer, probably more than most artists, hoped to approach perfection in his own work. An influential treatise, the De Occulta Philosophia of Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim, almost certainly known to Dürer, probably holds the explanation for the number I in the title: creativity in the arts was the realm of the imagination, considered the first and lowest in the hierarchy of the three categories of genius. The next was the realm of reason, and the highest the realm of spirit. It is ironic that this image of the artist paralyzed and powerless exemplifies Dürer's own artistic power at its superlative height."
St. Jerome in his Study,Durer Albrecht,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"The engraving [i]St. Jerome in his Study[/i] (1514) depicts the scholar-saint in his study in a meditative state. St. Jerome, one of four fathers of the Church, was the first to translate the Bible to Latin. Considered one of the greatest biblical scholars, St. Jerome is the patron of translators, librarians and encyclopedists. He was admired and celebrated among Renaissance humanists, including Dürer himself. In fact, Dürer featured St. Jerome more than any other saint in his work. Coincidentally, in the same year Dürer created the engraving, his friend and one of leaders of the Protestant Reformation in Nuremberg, Lazarus Spengler, published the biography of St. Jerome. In the engraving, Dürer shows an ideal state of contemplative solitude, which appeals to Renaissance humanists. The artist creates the space with perspectival accuracy, and it was even suggested that the study resembled one of the upper rooms of Dürer’s house. The engraving projects an atmosphere of intimate domesticity: the room is illuminated by a soft light, while St. Jerome works at his desk and his loyal companions, the lion and the dog, rest in the foreground. The lion is traditionally St. Jerome’s companion, referring to the story in which St. Jerome domesticated the animal, after pulling a thorn from his paw. Other details, such as the slippers under the bench and the numerous cushions, give a sense of domestic warmth and comfort.

The engraving is often analyzed together with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albrecht-durer/melancholia-1514][i]Melencolia I[/i][/url] (1514), another famous engraving by Dürer. Documents show that on occasion Dürer gave away the two engravings as a pair. The two engravings show two sides of the intellectual pursuit, the traditional divide of divine and secular knowledge. Thus, in the engravings, St. Jerome represents the ideal of theological wisdom juxtaposed by the frustration of the secular genius in [i]Melencolia I[/i]. The contrast between the engravings is highlighted through composition and lighting. The space in [i]St. Jerome in his Study[/i] is meticulous and orderly, each object has its particular place and the overall mood is serene and harmonious. On the other hand, the objects in [i]Melencolia I[/i] are scattered in haphazard manner, which reflect the somber atmosphere. In the same way, the sunlit interior of St. Jerome’s study is opposed to the darkness that envelopes the personification of Melancholia.

One of the interesting details in the engraving is the gourd vine hanging from the threshold in the right corner of the room. In the Bible, the plant is mentioned in the [i]Book of Jonah[/i], where God prepared a gourd to give Jonah shade, to help relieve him from his grief. St. Jerome translated the name of the plant as [i]hedera[/i], a type of ivy, and rejected the old Latin translation of [i]cucurbita[/i], a gourd. This prompted a philological debate with St. Augustine in a letter exchange in the years 403-404. The gourd is also a symbol of transience: in the story of Jonah the gourd arose and perished in a night at God’s command. Therefore, the gourd can relate to the skull resting on the window sill, and interpreted as a [i]memento mori[/i], a reminder of the temporality of life. In the context of the scholarly atmosphere, the gourd hints at the philological discussion between St. Jerome and St. Augustine, and celebrates scholarly debate and theological wisdom."
Landscape near Antwerp,Braque Georges ,Fauvism,landscape,"This painting is representative of Braque’s fauvist style. He first exhibited his early fauvist works at the Salon des Indepedants in March of 1906, many of which he later destroyed in a fit of uncertainty. In June of the same year, Braque and a painter friend traveled to Antwerp. The port of Antwerp, one of the biggest ports in Europe, was similar to his home town of Le Havre. Braque thus felt comfortable enough to stay and paint during his time there, all the while still feeling as if he were somewhere new. Heavily influenced by Paul Cezanne, Braque most likely painted Landscape near Antwerp in the technique that Cezanne used most, painting and drawing at the same time. As such, there is no preliminary drawing for this painting; it was painted on the spot."
Still life with Basket of Apples,Braque Georges ,Fauvism,still life,"According to all art historians, seven paintings from 1906 have been destroyed by Braque, making this still life especially rare. The work by its composition is influenced - tribute to Cézanne (basket and apples) which has been a critical influence on Braque's artistic development after seeing at the Salon a large amount of his works the same year."
Houses at Estaque,Braque Georges ,Analytical Cubism,cityscape,"Braque's paintings made over the summer of 1908 at l'Estaque are considered the first Cubist paintings. After being rejected by the Salon d'Automne, they were fortunately exhibited that fall at Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler's Paris gallery. These simple landscape paintings showed Braque's determination to break imagery into dissected parts. The brown and green palette here also predicts a palette that Braque employed in many paintings to come."
Harbor in Normandy,Braque Georges ,Analytical Cubism,landscape,"Braque painted this scene from memory in the spring of 1909, and it is a great example of the way in which Braque, as well as other cubist painters, created a textured mat of forms in the sky. Instead of an open space, filled with color, the sky in the Harbor in Normandy is just as full of forms as the landscape in the painting. It marks a new moment in spatial sensation, the whole painting with all the elements, from the lighthouse, boats and sky, are brought to life by the interaction and shading of their planes."
Woman with a Mandolin,Braque Georges ,Analytical Cubism,genre painting,"Woman with a Mandolin was painted by Braque in the spring of 1910, during the phase of analytical Cubism, the initial stage in the movement. In it the artist returns to the human figure after devoting himself exclusively to landscape and still life for two years. Perhaps this return was prompted by the impression that viewing twenty-four of Camille Corot’s paintings at the Salon d’Automne of 1909 made on him. Corot showed him how the addition of a musical instrument infuses the person portrayed with the calm of a still life, and the allegorical and expressive possibilities of the theme were coupled with Braque’s great passion for music. Corot’s seated women in melancholic poses holding musical instruments impressed both Braque and Picasso, whose works display their mark. Both artists were quick to respond to the stimuli of the nineteenth-century master and during the first months of 1910 Braque made several experimental drawings and painted the present rectangular Woman with a Mandolin in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza and another in an oval shape, the first Cubist painting to be executed in that format. Around the same time Picasso produced an oval Woman with a Mandolin and a rectangular Woman with a Mandolin (Fanny Tellier). As Christopher Green points out, with these two oval paintings on canvas, the oval format — typical of eighteenth-century decorative painting — made its full appearance in Cubism.
Like the still-life objects Braque had painted the previous year, the figure in Woman with a Mandolin breaks down into its different components, which are joined together again in a new arrangement. In this phase of the fragmentation of form, the artist employs a narrow range of ochres , greys and browns. Despite this reduced palette, Braque achieves many painterly effects using a Divisionist technique of small brushstrokes and a very loose and luminous facture. Background and figure fuse into a web of vertical and horizontal lines, into a spatial continuum composed of small, interpenetrating planes. Some fragments are recognizable , such as the mandolin and the hand that holds it, while others, such as the head and shoulders, are so well integrated into the abstract space of the background plane that they are barely discernible.
Woman with a Mandolin was purchased by André Breton at the sale of the possessions confiscated from the German dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler in 1921. Years later it belonged to André Lefèvre , the most important collector of Cubism in the interwar period."
Clarinet and Bottle of Rum on a Mantelpiece,Braque Georges ,Analytical Cubism,still life,"Clarinet and Bottle of Rum on the Mantlepiece is typical of Braque's subject matter, yet is unique as an early example of collage. In this painting, he stenciled the word ""valse"" to mean ""waltz,"" in continuation with his interest in musical themes and instruments. ""RHU"" are first three letters for the French word for rum. Again using an exploded perspective, the viewer barely perceives a scroll in the lower right corner, which could allude to a human head, a violin or cello, or the mantelpiece in the title."
The Portuguese (The Emigrant),Braque Georges ,Analytical Cubism,portrait,"Le Portugais marks an interesting point in the development of Braque’s paintings. In the top right hand corner, he stenciled the letters “D BAL” and under them, roman numerals. Although he had included numbers and letters into a still life in 1910, they were a representational element of the painting. In this piece, the letters and numbers are a purely compositional addition. Braque’s intentions at adding the letters are many, but mostly they are added to make the viewer aware of the canvas itself. In representational paintings, the canvas is there only as a surface to hold whatever image the painter desires. By adding numbers, out of context elements, and surface textures, the viewer becomes aware of the fact that the canvas can also hold outside elements, making the surface of the painting just as important as what is put on top of it."
Bottle and Fishes,Braque Georges ,Analytical Cubism,still life,"Braque depicted both bottles and fishes throughout his entire painting career, and these objects stand as markers to differentiate his various styles. Bottle and Fishes is an excellent example of Braque's foray into Analytic Cubism, while he worked closely with Picasso. This painting has the restricted characteristic earth tone palette rendering barely perceptible objects as they disintegrate along a horizontal plane. While there are some diagonal lines, Braque's early paintings tended to work vertically or horizontally."
Fruit Dish and Glass,Braque Georges ,"Analytical Cubism, Synthetic Cubism",still life,"While they worked together in the French Pyrenees, Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso developed the methods of collage and papier colle. Developed specifically by Braque, papier colle is the method of creating a collage of flat pieces of material, arranged on the surface to form the shapes of what the painting is representing. Fruitdish and Glass is said to be the first attempt ever at a papier colle painting, in which Braque used textured pieces of wallpaper to create the collage. As a further textural element, Braque also included sand and sawdust into his painted works."
"Violin and Pipe, 'Le Quotidien'",Braque Georges ,Synthetic Cubism,still life,"Collage helped Braque to realize that, ""color acts simultaneously with form but has nothing to do with it,"". He made collages to inspire painting compositions, but also as works themselves. In Violin and Pipe, he chooses a stringed instrument as his subject matter. Since there is no concrete evidence that this is a violin, one can understand better how Braque is studying the shapes within the object and pulling them apart to move them around, as if shuffling a deck of cards."
Fruit on a Tablecloth with a Fruitdish,Braque Georges ,"Cubism, Expressionism",still life,"The subject matter of this painting commemorates a banquet held in Braque's honor upon returning from the war. Picasso and Gris made headway in Synthetic Cubism, while Braque resumed the development of his own style, still Cubist, but more concentrated on color and texture. Fruit on a Table-cloth with a Fruit Dish shows a table display flattened out in the pictorial plane as Braque had done many times before, but here he replicates the texture of wood and marble, and even shades the fruit."
The Bowl of Grapes,Braque Georges ,Cubism,still life,"After his return from World War I, Braque broke with Pablo Picasso and began painting many still lifes, developing his cubist technique. Although he remained true to his cubist forms, his lines became softer and longer, and there was a more simplistic treating of what had been overly complex representations of forms. Many of his still lifes, as exemplified by this painting, include broad flat frontal planes, which are often discreet, and sometimes ornately patterned. In the peripheral areas of the painting, Braque added sand to his pigment, including an additional element to the painting, enhancing its textual variation."
Woman with the easel,Braque Georges ,"Cubism, Expressionism",genre painting,"The painting is marked by the sand-laced pigment and curvilinear forms of Braque's later work and presents a seated female artist with palette and brush in hand. Set in the artist's own Varengeville studio on the Normandy coast, it is one of about ten paintings that depicts figures engaging in artistic or musical activities."
Balustre et Crane,Braque Georges ,"Cubism, Expressionism",vanitas,"Balustre et Crane predicts a series of still lifes Braque created called Vanitas, in which objects symbolize agony or mental misery. He painted skulls repeatedly following his return from war and during the onset of World War II. In these paintings, Balustre et Crane in particular, Braque uses a bright array of colors to represent emotional reactions to the political discomfort he felt about the war."
Carnival Evening,Rousseau Henri,Naïve Art (Primitivism),genre painting,"Although Rousseau is most widely known for his jungle motifs, he was also adept at a style of painting that he coined “portrait landscape.” These paintings included a landscape in the background of the painting, and a portrait in the foreground of the piece. This painting includes a forest in the background, which was one of the painting types first produced and displayed by Rousseau, foreshadowing his complex jungle scenes. Critics were initially baffled at the images of the people, who in many cases were strangely costumed, and somehow located in the middle of a large and foreboding forest. This painting is also notable for its lack of perspective, as the entire image is painted in one dimensional pane, as if on a backdrop."
Tiger in a Tropical Storm (Surprised!),Rousseau Henri,Naïve Art (Primitivism),wildlife painting,"Because the jury at the Academie de peinture et de sculpture would not accept his work, Tiger in a Tropical Storm, Rouseau had to enter it under a different name, Surprise, at the Salon de Independants, which was open to all artists. The painting was not a smash hit, as it received mixed reviews, ranging from ridicule at the childish naiveté of the painting, to the understanding and acclaim at its technical complexity, and with it he received his first recognition as an accomplished artist. Although there are tales (which may have been spread by himself) that Rousseau had studied the flora and fauna of the jungle during his travels in Mexico, he never left France, and learned all he knew of the jungle from botanical gardens, textbooks, and oral accounts."
The Sleeping Gypsy,Rousseau Henri,Naïve Art (Primitivism),genre painting,"Rousseau described the subject of The Sleeping Gypsy: “A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.” A toll collector for the city of Paris, Rousseau was a largely self-taught painter, although he had ambitions of entering the Academy. This goal was never realized, but his sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines—derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture— struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters, including Pablo Picasso, Vasily Kandinsky, and Frida Kahlo."
The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope,Rousseau Henri,Naïve Art (Primitivism),wildlife painting,"Due to the negative reviews of Tiger in a Tropical Storm, Rousseau did not paint another jungle scene until seven years later. The Hungry Lion Throws itself on the Antelope was the second jungle scene he painted after his return to painting the flora and fauna of the jungle, which was based off of the diorama of stuffed animals in the Paris Natural History Museum. Upon its exhibition, it was derided by its critics, who were shocked at its display alongside establishment paintings and Renaissance sculptures. Works such as this continued to be ridiculed by his critics until his death in 1910, by he was lauded by his contemporary independent artists, such as Matisse, Picasso, and Toulouse-Lautrec."
The Dream,Rousseau Henri,Naïve Art (Primitivism),allegorical painting,"Created in the same year as his death, The Dream was Rousseau’s last painting, which was debuted only a few months before his untimely death. Upon its debut, Guillaume Apollinaire, referencing the negative reviews of previous years, exclaimed that this year, there would be no ridicule, as the painting exuded sheer beauty. With this piece, Rousseau brought together the exotic and the ordinary, the jungle and the couch, and combined the two to form a juxtaposition of composition which engages and intrigues. It is perhaps fitting that this was his last painting before his death, as it was his masterpiece."
The Wedding,Leger Fernand ,Cubism,genre painting,"""Through the exceptional format and radical treatment of this manifesto-painting, Fernand Léger confirmed his place within the Cubist movement. A nuptial procession advances vertically around a married couple in a frontal space that is blurred by nebulous forms. Classical perspective is shattered into pieces by fragmentation and multiple points of view. Considered to be incomprehensible, the canvas caused a scandal: ""I'm told it represents a slice of brawn with pistachios seen through a magnifying glass"", one critic wrote. Only Apollinaire had a positive opinion: ""Léger's work stands out as pure painting. No subject, a lot of talent."""
The Сity,Leger Fernand ,Cubism,cityscape,"The city is an example of the ways in which Leger can be seen as the forerunner of Pop Art. The images in The City evoke the chaos of living in a hustling and bustling metropolitan expanse. Small pieces of billboards, store windows and building overlap each other, giving off a sense of chaos, excitement, and movement, creating a scene in which not one single element can be viewed as a whole. Leger, who was a proponent of technology and mechanical prowess, used his illustration of the city to represent the colorful world of modern technology. Rather than being overwhelmed by the advances, Leger saw in them the ability to cure the ills of the post-war world."
Three Women,Leger Fernand ,Cubism,portrait,"Three Women is an example of Leger’s smooth forms, created with machine-like solidity and a precision reminiscent of technology. In the tradition of classical images of female nudes, the three women recline in a chic apartment, sipping their drinks. The bodies of the women have been simplified into clean forms of smooth shapes, their smooth skin polished like metal. After serving in World War I, in which he was badly injured, Leger hoped that technological advances and the machine age would cure the chaos unleashed by the war. His quasi-mechanical shapes exemplify his intent to use art as a representation of the possibilities of the machine age."
Woman with a Cat,Leger Fernand ,Cubism,nude painting (nu),"One of the large female nudes, of which Leger created many, Woman with a Cat was produced during Leger’s “mechanical period.” Indicative of his love for mechanical and technological advance, the woman in the painting seems to be made of a rubbery substance, made up of the geometrical shapes of cones, cubes, and cylinders. The simplicity of the figure, which has no facial features, is complimented by the stark color palette, including only red, black, yellow and white. Leger also produced variations of this figure, including a smaller, near identical painting to this one."
Woman with a Book,Leger Fernand ,Cubism,portrait,"Leger believed that the mechanical age had the capability of curing the chaos that occurred during World War I, and reduced the figures in his paintings to mechanical shapes for this very purpose. In Woman with a Book, Leger has reduced the shape of the woman down to simple forms, which have been placed back together like a machine. This portrait thus gives of the impression that the woman is a mechanized version of herself. The simple, solidified forms were Leger’s attempt to use enduring images to recover from the devastation of the war. This portrait gives off the impression that the woman’s strong stance and solid figure offers comfort after the tribulations of war."
Mona Lisa with the keys,Leger Fernand ,Purism,figurative,"One day I had painted a bunch of keys on a canvas, my bunch of keys. I didn’t know what to put next to them. I needed something that would be the absolute opposite of a bunch of keys. So when I finished work I went out. I had only walked a few yard when what should I see in a shop windows? A postcard of the Mona Lisa! At once I knew that was what I needed; what could have made a greater contrast to the keys?. ..Then I also added a can of sardines. It was such a strong contrast. 
La vie fait de l’Oeuvre de Fernand Léger, Dora Vallier, Cahiers d’Art, 2, 1954, p. 153"
The Creation of the World,Leger Fernand ,Cubism,design,"In addition to his paintings, Leger was a prolific artist in many mediums, including stained glass, ceramic sculpture, and set designs. This is a set design is for the ballet The Creation of the World, which premiered in Paris in 1923. The ballet is based on an African creation legend, and Leger’s artistic rendition illustrates the three gods of the ballet, Nzame, Medere and N’kava. According to the legend, the gods oversee the development of the flora and fauna into a coordinated dance. According to the composer of the ballet, Leger was never quite happy with his designs, as he wanted them to be more frightening and less bright."
Portrait of Maude Abrantes,Modigliani Amedeo ,Expressionism,portrait,"This painting is one of Modigliani’s earlier works, and as such has much more of a traditional look. This painting is also indicative of the artist’s later style in the figure’s elongated neck and the still, somber emotion on her face. There is also much more detail in her clothing and her face than in Modigliani’s later works, which are characterized by simple lines and few discernable features. Early on as an artist, Modigliani preferred life-drawn women subjects, many of whom engaged in love affairs with the handsome painter. One only wonders if this was one such subject."
Madame Pompadour,Modigliani Amedeo ,Expressionism,portrait,"This is one of the most famous portraits created by Modigliani. The painting is of a woman named Beatrice Hastings, who had a love affair with the artist for over two years, and sat for many of his paintings. This portrait illustrates the artist’s style of turning the face into a mask-like image, and the elongation of the form of the body, in this case an exaggeratedly long and thin neck. The subject is also perhaps a bit of a social critique, as the pompadour is also in his stylized, exaggerated form of simple lines, using a traditional image to steer away from the traditional style of painting."
Portrait of Diego Rivera,Modigliani Amedeo ,Expressionism,portrait,"In addition to this painting of Diego Rivera, a famous muralist, Modigliani painted many portraits of his peers, including Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, and Chaim Soutine, among others influential philosophers and thinkers of his time. Strangely, this painting deviates from Modigliani’s norms of elongated features and simple forms. There is a great amount of texture on Rivera’s face, which is the most complete area of the painting, the lines and strokes fading away as you get farther from the face. Rivera seems to be amusedly sitting for the painter, who with quick brush strokes, is quickly capturing his form."
Jeanne Hebuterne in Red Shawl,Modigliani Amedeo ,Expressionism,portrait,"The subject of this painting was Modigliani’s longtime love and partner, Jeanne Hebuterne. The young woman renounced her family and her Roman Catholic background to be with the painter, and the couple soon had one daughter. After two years together, Modigliani died of the tuberculosis from which he suffered the majority of his life. Jeanne, grief-stricken and inconsolable, threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, killing herself and their unborn child. Complete with a long, thin frame and head cocked coyly to the side, the painting is done with such care and simple beauty that you can almost see Jeanne through Modigliani’s eyes."
Sleeping Nude with Arms Open (Red Nude),Modigliani Amedeo ,Expressionism,nude painting (nu),"In 1917, Modigliani held a one-man exhibition in Paris, which was closed within a few hours by the Paris Chief of Police, who considered the nudes shocking and scandalous. This painting was created in 1917, and thus it may be the culprit behind Modigliani’s failure, as it was the only exhibition he ever held. Unlike his other more elongated forms, the nude body of the woman is graciously painted with flowing curves and a sensual texture; the mask-like face with eyes full of mystery, and a slight smile to the lips. It is not so scandalous and shocking as it is a celebration of the woman’s form and her sensual nature."
Equality before Death,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,Neoclassicism,allegorical painting,"Equality is Bouguereau's first major painting, produced when he was a young man of 23, after two years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris. Subjected to heavy pressure from his family, the artist knew he had to succeed at any cost. As the critic Léon Plée would write later, he was then ""in a hurry to make his name"".

For his first submission to the Salon, Bouguereau presented this spectacular, large format painting of an angel of death covering the body of a young man with a shroud. The image would move anyone with its evocation of the inevitability of death. This sombre vision serves as a warning, as this note on a preparatory drawing demonstrates: ""Equality. When the angel of death covers you with its shroud, your life will have been meaningless if you have not done some good on earth” But the equality in question is not exactly the same as that which Liberals all over Europe aspired to achieve in 1848. Bouguereau is keeping to a conservative and deeply religious idea, where equality, far from being a social or political objective, only exists in the afterlife. The painting is therefore reminding us of both Bouguereau's anxiety about the political changes of his time and his more personal doubts about his own future.

With its concise style and frieze-like structure, the painting is reminiscent of the purism of the English Neo-Classical artist John Flaxman (1755-1826). Its funereal, dramatic character also links it to the Romantics. We are reminded of the famous painting by Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758-1823), Justice and Divine Vengeance pursuing Crime (1808, Paris, Musée du Louvre), and more recently of work by Henry Lehmann (1814-1882), Jeremy dictating his Prophesies (1842, Angers, Musée des Beaux-Arts), featuring similarly implacable angel figures."
Dante and Virgil,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,Neoclassicism,literary painting,"Having failed on two occasions to win the Prix de Rome (1848 and 1849), Bouguereau was hungry for revenge. His early submissions to the Salon reveal this fierce desire to succeed. After his ambitious Equality before Death (1849), the young man aimed to create an impression once again. He put forward an even larger painting inspired by Dante whose work was much loved by the Romantics and who captured all its dramatic beauty. This painting was inspired by a short scene from the Inferno, set in the eighth circle of Hell (the circle for falsifiers and counterfeiters), where Dante, accompanied by Virgil, watches a fight between two damned souls: Capocchio, a heretic and alchemist is attacked and bitten on the neck by Gianni Schicchi who had usurped the identity of a dead man in order to fraudulently claim his inheritance.

The critic and poet Théophile Gautier was very complimentary: ""Gianni Schicchi throws himself at Capocchio, his rival, with a strange fury, and Monsieur Bouguereau depicts magnificently through muscles, nerves, tendons and teeth, the struggle between the two combatants. There is bitterness and strength in this canvas – strength, a rare quality!” In fact, Bouguereau here shows great boldness. He is exploring the aesthetic boundaries: exaggerating the muscle structure to the point of distorting it, exaggerating the poses, contrasting colour and shadows, depicting monstrous figures and groups of damned souls. We are particularly reminded of the sublime visions of Romantic artists like Blake (1757-1827), Füssli (1741-1825), and Lawrence (1769-1830). Everything in this painting underlines the feeling of terribilita and horror: a theme to which Bouguereau would never again return."
Birth Of Venus,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,"Neoclassicism, Academicism",mythological painting,"Bouguereau's rendition of a well-known Roman mythology tale portrays Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, emerging from the sea on a shell, surrounded by a group of nymphs, tritons, and putti who admire her. The goddess assumes the classic contrapposto stance of Venus Anadyomene, accentuating the curves of her body while adjusting her hair. The painting's cool pastel hues create an atmosphere that evokes the dewy world of the sea.

Bouguereau drew inspiration from Renaissance masterworks like Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea and Botticelli's Birth of Venus, which he studied during his Prix de Rome scholarship in Italy. Unlike Raphael and Botticelli's nudes, Bouguereau's Venus displays a refined naturalism that reflects the new artistic tastes of the 1870s while retaining a Neoclassical artifice. The painting satisfies the challenge set by T.J. Clark for late-19th-century Salon painters to depict the flesh of modern women in Naturalist style while adhering to the Academic ideal of ""the body as a sign, formal and generalized, meant for a token of composure and fulfillment."" Although Bouguereau's Venus is technically perfect and realistic, she lacks individual identity and remains confined to the role of an ideal.

Bouguereau's Venus received much acclaim and proved to be a commercial success. The painting's strong eroticism hints at Bouguereau's pragmatic methods of appealing to buyers. Unlike Botticelli's Venus, who hides her bosom seductively, Bouguereau's Venus invites the viewer to examine every part of her, unashamed of her nakedness and sensuality."
Young Girl Defending Herself Against Eros,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,Academicism,mythological painting,"One of Bouguereau's most famous works portrays a dark-haired maiden, based on one of his most popular models, pushing away a cherub attempting to pierce her breast with an arrow. The two engage in a playful tug-of-war, and the girl's resistance to Eros appears minimal. As her veil falls, her innocent appearance takes on a semi-unintentional sexual appeal, adding to the painting's voyeuristic allure.

This work exemplifies Bouguereau's classical and mythological scenes infused with sensuality. While they sold well with a new market of wealthy American buyers, they were often ridiculed by his Impressionist contemporaries. Some critics and artists even accused Bouguereau of being a lecherous painter preoccupied with female nudes and devaluing the legacy of his Renaissance predecessors, such as Raphael, by producing cheap, erotic imitations of their work.

However, stylistically and thematically, this painting is not as straightforwardly cliché as it may appear. The landscape depicted in the background is based on contemporary France, likely the rural south, where Bouguereau spent many of his formative years. Therefore, the work offers a superficially modernized approach to its subject matter. Furthermore, Bouguereau's skillful mastery of the human form and subtle tonal contrasts is evident in the painting."
Dawn,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,"Neoclassicism, Academicism",allegorical painting,"Bouguereau's Dawn marks the beginning of a four-piece series depicting different stages of the day, including Dusk (1882), Night (1883), and Day (1884). The painting portrays a nude woman gracefully dancing on the surface of a pond, holding a lily in her arm as she reaches to smell it. Bouguereau's skillful depiction of the dancer's pose, with her balancing on the water's skin, and the soft cool tones of her skin reflect the tranquil atmosphere of early morning. The diaphanous drapery swirling around her, combined with her suspended pose and mirrored reflection, create an otherworldly effect.

Throughout his career, Bouguereau repeatedly employed the motif of the female nude, arranging the body in various suggestive poses while often referencing myths or literature. His focus on the single figure in works such as Dawn allowed him to showcase his mastery of line and handling of subtle color contrasts, resulting in a sinuous and atmospheric depiction of early morning. The model's fingers and toes tinged with pink reflect Homer's description of daybreak as ""rosy-fingered dawn, the child of morning."" Despite the lack of a specific mythological or literary reference, Bouguereau always imbued his female nudes with a sense of classicism and poetry.

Adolphe Goupil, Bouguereau's regular dealer, acquired the 'times-of-day' series, which he then sold to various American collectors. The sale of the series is a testament to Bouguereau's unparalleled critical and commercial success in both European and American art markets during his lifetime."
The Nut Gatherers,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,Academicism,genre painting,"In a grassy clearing, two young girls take a break from collecting hazelnuts. One girl holds a handful of nuts while the other is engrossed in play or a shared secret. Bouguereau's genre painting portrays everyday life, often featuring women and girls in agricultural or domestic settings. The girls in The Nut Gatherers are dressed plainly as peasants but appear unusually clean and content.

During the 1880s, the Paris Salon's official preferences shifted towards Naturalism, as demonstrated by the success of Jules Bastien-Lepage's Hay Makers (1877). Bouguereau was aware of these market changes and adapted his works accordingly, although his genre paintings retained the idealized perfection of his Neoclassical pieces.

Critics have accused Bouguereau of being overly sentimental, and The Nut Gatherers could support such claims. However, his later works demonstrate a remarkable naturalistic precision, exploring themes such as family relationships, contemplation, and harmony with nature. Mark Steven Walker wrote about Bouguereau's view of peasant life for an exhibition catalogue, praising the ""heroic attention required to sustain such a vision of perfection in a less than perfect age."" The Nut Gatherers remains popular today, with the Detroit Institute of Arts citing it as one of their most beloved works after purchasing it in 1952."
The Young Shepherdess,Bouguereau William-Adolphe,Academicism,portrait,"Bouguereau's painting The Young Shepherdess (1885) depicts a lone girl standing in a vast pasture, facing it with a sense of responsibility as the shepherdess of the flock of sheep within it. Though she looks back at the viewer with a friendly and curious gaze, she maintains an air of propriety. In his later years, Bouguereau painted numerous rustic genre scenes that appealed greatly to collectors, particularly those depicting young girls in pastoral settings. His sentimentalized portrayal of peasant life, which differed from the more realistic approach of artists like Courbet and Millet, nonetheless showcased his technical mastery of naturalistic figure painting.

Although Bouguereau's depictions of the peasantry have been criticized as pandering to market tastes, some art historians argue that he also celebrated their nobility and humility. While his genre scenes often idealize peasant women, treating them as if they were Raphael Madonnas, he also imbued certain individuals with unique personalities that complicated his general commercializing approach. However, Bouguereau never took a strong moral or sociological stance on the underclass like his contemporaries did, and his political views tended to lean towards conservatism when expressed. The Young Shepherdess, in particular, was based on one of the Italian immigrant girls whom Bouguereau employed as models during family vacations in La Rochelle. These girls received a monthly salary, performed household chores, and shared meals with his family."

Officer of the Chasseurs Charging on Horseback (Charging Hussar),Gericault Theodore ,Romanticism,battle painting,"As reflected in the title, Géricault's [i]Charging Chasseur[/i] is a large-scale portrait featuring an officer in the French Imperial Guard charging away from the viewer. In the background, a battle scene suggests that retreat is underway. The officer is a real-life figure, Alexandre Dieudonné, who was a friend of the artist. He is depicted twisting backward, sword ready, in a dramatically contorted pose.

Military figures were among the artist's favorite themes, with this being one of his earliest and yet most important examples. The work also utilizes another favored subject of the artist, the horse, which he returned to throughout his career. The scene Géricault chose to depict is not a moment of military victory, as was commonly represented by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neoclassicism]Neoclassical[/url] artists of the period. Everything in the narrative implies that the battle is about to be lost. The officer seems to look back in sad resignation. Instead of an idealized scene created using Ancient Roman or Greek motifs, as was common in the French Neoclassical style, Géricault chose to depict a romanticized scene full of drama. The tension is enhanced by bold color choices and varied light effects. His depiction reinforces the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] idea of the hero who, rather than seen triumphing, is shown struggling, brooding, or sad in the face of uncertain fate.

The choice of the subject could be seen as slightly ironic, given that his father had found a way to get him out of military service. Perhaps the work was an attempt to give visual form to the military drama that Géricault so admired but had not yet seen first hand. Whatever the work's motivations, it helped to launch Géricault's career and was well-received when it was exhibited at the 1812 Paris Salon."
Carabinier,Gericault Theodore ,Romanticism,portrait,"Note: the term [i]carabinier[/i] translates literally as ""rifleman,"" but these soldiers were heavy cavalry who--in an earlier period--were mounted riflemen. Napoleon made them into cuirassiers, but they kept their old name."
A Horse frightened by Lightning,Gericault Theodore ,Romanticism,animal painting,"Géricault was a keen horseman, and his expert understanding of horses' anatomy matched his passion for them. In 1813 he produced several oil studies and finished paintings, possibly including this one, of horses at the Imperial stables at Versailles. These paintings demonstrate close observation and detailed naturalism.

In this picture, we see a fine thoroughbred. Géricault has shown the moment it reacts to a bolt of lightning (in the upper right corner), and presumably, the accompanying clap of thunder. He avoided the more dramatic, and perhaps rather clichéd, image of a horse rearing, instead of showing the animal in profile as it freezes in fear.

Géricault brilliantly captured the sheen of the dappled coat as it is momentarily lit up against the near blackness of the night sky. Using short, staccato strokes of liquid paint, which precisely follow the contours of the horse's body, he created an effect of nervous energy that ripples across its silky surface."
Male 'académie' Seated and Seen from Behind,Gericault Theodore ,Romanticism,"sketch and study, nude painting (nu)","Géricault painted this work at the beginning of his career while training in the studio of the French Academy painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-narcisse-guerin]Pierre-Narcisse Guérin[/url]. This complex atmospheric composition shows off the young artist's ambition. The male [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/nude-painting-nu]nude[/url], viewed from behind, is twisted across the canvas. The tension in his intertwined feet unfurls progressively as the eye ascends towards the figure's right hand. The work is dark and brooding other than the whites and yellows of the figure's flesh.

While the depiction of the nude was nothing new - nude studies or académies were an essential part of an artist's training - the way Géricault rendered the subject shows how revolutionary his approach to artmaking would be throughout his tragically short career. Conventional student studies of the male nude would have included a traditional, frontal pose set in a studio. This is abandoned entirely by Géricault who places the figure in a landscape and experiments with a radical way of presenting the body that allows for an exploration of his already developed understanding of anatomy. The dramatic [i]contrapposto[/i] of the male nude also seems to presage the artist's later interest in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url] and the expressive possibilities inherent in the body itself. Besides, the moody deployment of light and shade was unlike other student académies of the period. Through this work, we can anticipate the development of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism#!#resultType:masonry]Romanticism[/url].

Géricault's teacher did not enthusiastically accept this work. Guérin was known to continually criticize the artist for what he considered his unrealistic depiction of form and use of color. About these studies, he chastised Géricault by stating, ""your colors are not realistic ... all these [i]chiaroscuro[/i] contrasts would lead me to think that you always paint under the moonlight; as for your académies they resemble nature as much as a violin case resembles a violin."""
The Raft of the Medusa,Gericault Theodore ,"Romanticism, Realism",history painting,"The epic painting [i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i] features a gruesome mass of figures afloat at sea, some dead, some struggling for life, in a tangled mass positioned on a crudely-made raft. The only African figure on the raft waves a cloth at the top of a pile of a few men who are struggling to get the attention of a ship in the distance (located on the far right of the horizon line). The sail of the raft is billowing in the wind while being tossed about a choppy ocean beneath a stormy sky. Géricault paid great attention to the details in this work. He even [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/heads-of-torture-victims-study-for-the-raft-of-the-medusa]sketched severed body parts[/url] in order to make the image as authentic as possible.

The subject depicted is the artist's dramatic interpretation of the events beginning on July 2, 1816, when a French navy frigate crashed on its way to colonies in West Africa. The appointed governor of the colony and the top-ranking officers in the party left on the ship's six lifeboats leaving the remaining 147 passengers to be crowded onto a hastily made raft. When the raft proved too cumbersome, in a horrific act of cowardice and fear, the ship's leader cut the ropes to the raft. Left to fend for themselves for 13 days, the passengers eventually resorted to cannibalism. When rescued by a passing British ship, only 15 men were left alive, of whom 5 died before they were able to reach land. When the public learned of this, it became an international tragedy and a searing indictment of the current French government. 

The decision to paint a scene from contemporary history - one that was utterly of the moment - brought instant attention to this work, particularly as Gericault translated it in a manner befitting classical history painting (large-scale, with heroic and tragic elements). The painting shocked the public and divided critics at the 1819 Salon. The shipwreck had scandalous political implications at home—the incompetent captain, who had gained the position because of connections to the Bourbon Restoration government, fought to save himself and senior officers while leaving the lower ranks to die—and so Géricault’s picture of the raft and its inhabitants was greeted with hostility by the government. Critics were divided: the horror and ""[i]terribilità[/i]"" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a ""pile of corpses,"" whose realism they considered a far cry from the ""ideal beauty"" incarnated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Girodet[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/pygmalion-et-galat-e-1819][i]Pygmalion and Galatea[/i] [/url](1819) which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Coupin (art critic of the Revue encyclopédique) was categorical: ""Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.""

Disappointed by the reception of [i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i], Géricault took the painting to England in 1820, where it was received as a sensational success. He remained there for two years, enjoying the equine culture and producing a body of lithographs, watercolors, and oils of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-horse-race-1824-1]jockeys and horses[/url]. 

This work is a key example of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] painting. In creating it, Géricault showed a complexity of composition and an almost unsettling portrayal of reality, differed from anything that had been seen before. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Delacroix[/url]'s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-liberty-leading-the-people-1830][i]Liberty Leading the People[/i][/url] (1830) borrows heavily from the style and composition while contemporary artists, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frank-stella]Frank Stella[/url], Peter Saul, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jeff-koons]Jeff Koons[/url], have taken direct inspiration from this work, which has achieved the status of an artistic icon."
Heads of Torture Victims (study for The Raft of the Medusa),Gericault Theodore ,Realism,still life,"Gericault's [i]Guillotined Heads[/i] presents a gruesome depiction of death and decay. The female head on the left has pallid white skin and closed eyes, while the male head is depicted with its mouth and eyes open, staring vacantly past the viewer. The jagged, rough marks on the neck reveal the brutal and painful death. These figures suffered at the guillotine. Here Gericault shows his brilliant mastery of [i]chiaroscuro[/i], seen in the contrasts of dark and light throughout the composition. The loose brushstrokes used to render both the faces and the cloth add to the work's dramatic appeal.

Severed limbs and body parts are the most striking subject in Géricault's oeuvre. The five works he created in this style are considered to be studies for the figures he would render in his most famous work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault/the-raft-of-the-medusa-1819][i]The Raft of the Medusa[/i][/url] (1818-1819). Always striving for authenticity, the artist kept dead body parts of victims of the guillotine in his studio. Gériault's use of horrific subject matter was first and foremost an artistic means of pushing the boundaries, but also the vehicle of a political message. By so clearly depicting the savagery involved in the use of the guillotine and presenting it in such a direct and confrontational way, Géricault is visually speaking out against this brutal form of punishment, which had been used widely during the Bourbon Restoration."
Head of an Oriental man (Portrait of Mustapha),Gericault Theodore ,"Romanticism, Orientalism",portrait,"The Orient—including present-day Turkey, Greece, the Middle East, and North Africa—exerted its allure on the Western artist’s imagination centuries prior to the turn of the nineteenth century. Figures in Middle Eastern dress appear in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance]Renaissance[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] works, and the opulent eroticism of harem scenes appealed to the French [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/rococo]Rococo[/url] aesthetic. Until this point, however, Europeans had minimal contact with the East, usually through trade and intermittent military campaigns. In 1798, a French army led by General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and occupied the country until 1801. The European presence in Egypt attracted Western travelers to the Near and Middle East and enhanced connection between two worlds.

Throughout his career, Géricault created many fine portraits. The subject of [i]Head of an Oriental man[/i] was a real man, a domestic servant of Géricault, a Tunisian Arab named Mustafa Sussen. Apparently, he was a survivor of a shipwreck. Géricault had found him in a Paris street and brought home as a model and companion. It is probably his features, dark eyes sad beneath his turban, that are depicted in several late studies of a Turk that strike the viewer as warmly individualized portraits. Mustafa posed as a model for other painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet]Anne-Louis Girodet[/url] ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/anne-louis-girodet/mustapha-1819][i]Mustapha[/i][/url], 1819) or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet]Horace Vernet[/url] ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/horace-vernet/a-man-in-oriental-costume-1818][i]A Man in Oriental Costume[/i][/url], 1818). 

A vital aspect of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] movement was the full embrace of exotic ""oriental"" themes in art. Like many artists of the period, Géricault was interested in the world beyond Western Europe. The artist desired to visit the Holy Land so that he could experience the Middle East in all its sounds, sights, and interactions. However, he never managed to travel there and therefore relied on books he read, works with related subjects he collected, and most importantly, his servant Mustapha. 

Géricault led the way for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orientalism]Orientalist[/url] artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix]Eugène Delacroix[/url], Léon Cognet, and Eugène Fromentin, whose travels in Northern Africa formed an essential part of their inspiration."
Perspective with a Portico,Canaletto,Rococo,capriccio,"Canaletto was awarded the Perspective Chair at the Venice Fine Arts Academy in 1763, at the age of 66, after a first refusal, in spite of his international renown.
As was the practice, Canaletto had to present the Academy with a work, but surprisingly the greatest vedutista of his day preferred a capriccio to a real view of Venice. He started the work after his appointment but didn't complete it until two years later.

Painted on a preparation of red ochre oil, the chromatic values of which have certainly since changed, ""Perspective with a portico"" recalls the courtyard and portico of the Ca’ d’Oro, - the house of gold. The architectural elements that characterise the famous Venetian palazzo are transformed by the artist and inserted into an imaginary setting.
As a bequest, this capriccio met with huge success, proved by the large number of existing replicas, some of which are signed by the hand of the master. It was exhibited on Saint Mark's Square during the Feast of Ascension ""to honour its author"" and was admired by numerous fellow artists, including Guardi."
The Franciscan,Orozco Jose Clemente,Muralism,genre painting,"[i]The Franciscan (El Franciscano)[/i] (1929) is a lithograph by Mexican artist José Clemente Orozco, that was created during his seven yearlong stay in the United States. In this period Orozco completed some of his most famous murals such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/prometheus-1930][i]Prometheus[/i][/url] (1930) at Pomona College in California and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-epic-of-american-civilization-dartmouth-college-cycle-1932-1934,resultType:masonry][i]The Epic of American Civilization[/i][/url] (1932-1934) at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He also exhibited in New York galleries, and at the encouragement of art dealer Carl Zigrosser of the Weyhe Gallery, he began making lithographs to reach a wider audience.

[i]The Franciscan[/i] is based on a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/the-franciscans-1926]detail[/url] from Orozco’s mural cycle painted at the National Preparatory School. The lithograph depicts an enormous friar bending over to embrace a skeletal indigenous figure kneeling in front of him. At first, it may seem like a warm gesture, but upon a second look, this appears to be a suffocating embrace. The weary figure is enclosed in the tight grip while his arms are thrown back helplessly. The artist purposefully highlights the physical contrast between the friar and the indigenous figure: the friar’s face is expressive, and his big robe hangs loosely on his robust frame. In contrast, the native’s body is naked, and his face is blurred. Unlike the bulky friar, the indigenous figure is emaciated, his ribs, ankle, and hip bones are exposed. [i]The Franciscan[/i] represents the relationship between the Church and the people: the institution crushes the people under weight of rituals, rules, tithes, and land domination. It is also a broader critique of Spanish colonialism and the unbalanced power structure between the colonizers and the indigenous population.

Orozco’s critical and sarcastic attitude is aligned with the political cartoons from publications in Mexican magazines such as [i]La Orquesta[/i] and [i]El Ahuizote[/i]. For example, the anonymous etching [i]The Cleric is not a Candidate[/i] (1904) published in 1904 in[i] El Ahuizote[/i] depicts a disingenuous bishop holding a starving native in his lap like a baby. In the lower section of the image, workers prepare for one of Porfirio Díaz’s rigged reelections, while the bishop tells them to consult him first. Another anonymous lithograph, [i]Where There are Pleasures, There are Pains[/i] (1863) published in [i]La Orquesta[/i] shares the cynical sentiments of [i]The Franciscan[/i]. The anonymous author depicts Napoleon III as Our Lady of Sorrows, however, the Virgin Mary’s iconographic attributes are altered: the memorial candles are two upright cannons, and the ‘pain daggers’ are marked with the different countries he invaded. The daggers marked with the phrase ‘Mexico’ represent the French troops' invasion of Mexico. Orozco, who spent his formative years as an illustrator drawing political cartoons for local magazines was certainly familiar with such cartoons. His early illustrations, like [i]Who Makes him Dance[/i] (1911) published in [i]El Ahuizote[/i] in 1911, were influenced by the local tradition of political satire and the pollical prints of Mexican printmaker José Guadalupe Posada. While [i]The Franciscan[/i] emphasizes broader concepts of human suffering, it still contains elements of Mexican graphic tradition that were important in Orozco’s artistic development."
Prometheus,Orozco Jose Clemente,Muralism,mythological painting,"In June 1930, Orozco completed his first major mural in the United States, [i]Prometheus[/i] (1930) at Pomona College in California. Orozco was commissioned to paint the mural in Frary Hall at the encouragement of José Pijoán, professor of Hispanic civilization and art history. Orozco stayed at the campus dormitory in Pomona College and painted the mural over two months.

The subject of the mural is the Greek myth about the Titan Prometheus, who stole the fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to humanity. The central mural depicts Prometheus reaching for fire, preparing to bring it to earth. The ceiling panel depicts stylized flames emerging from a composition of geometric forms – these are generally understood as a symbolic representation of God, the source of the fire of knowledge. Many have suggested that Orozco identified with the myth of Prometheus and have drawn parallels between the mural and his personal history. This was a frustrating time in Orozco’s career, he felt artistically isolated and underappreciated, often received by indifferent or hostile audiences. The fire was also a significant element in his personal history: when he was 21, he lost his left hand while making fireworks to celebrate Mexico’s Independence Day. In the mural, Prometheus’s right hand appears consumed by the flame, possibly signifying the artist’s loss.

The two side panels were designed by the artists but were painted in part by his assistant Jorge Juan Crespo de la Serna. The panel on the west wall, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/destruction-of-mythology-study-1930][i]Destruction of Mythology[/i][/url] shows the Greek gods Zeus, Hera and Io, whose gaze is frightened and concentrated on Prometheus. The panel on the east wall, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/strangulation-of-mythology-study-1930][i]Strangulation of Mythology[/i][/url] depicts male and female centaurs, the female centaur is caught in the coils of a giant serpent, while her infant throws his arms towards her. According to Orozco, the side panels represent “the ancient times that Prometheus is upsetting by giving the fire of knowledge to man”.

Prometheus holds a significant place in Orozco’s artistic development, and more broadly in the history of mural painting. Orozco joined the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/muralism]Muralism[/url] in 1923, and several of his early murals anticipate the motifs in [i]Prometheus[/i]. Even in his early experiments with fresco, Orozco painted giant muscular figures against a background of sun-like symbols. An example of this is the mural [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/omnisciencia-1925][i]Omniciencia[/i][/url] (1925) that deals with the theme of creation – in the central composition, a muscular female figure is kneeling clasping her hands upwards to receive the gift of fire. Like in [i]Prometheus[/i], the kneeling pose is positioned on the central axis in the composition. Additionally, there are similarities in the radiating motifs behind the central figures in the two murals. 

The Muralism movement was led by [i]Los Tres Grandes[/i], the three great Mexican muralists: Orozco, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera]Diego Rivera[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-alfaro-siqueiros]David Alfaro Siqueiros[/url]. [i]Prometheus[/i] was the first major mural painted in the United States by one of these three artists. The mural received acclaim almost immediately after its completion, it was praised by critics and the architect of Fray Hall, Sumner Spaulding. Later, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]abstract expressionist[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Jackson Pollock[/url] stated it was “the greatest painting in North America”."
Panel 5. The Coming of Quetzalcoatl - The Epic of American Civilization,Orozco Jose Clemente,Muralism,"history painting, symbolic painting","[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-epic-of-american-civilization-dartmouth-college-cycle-1932-1934,resultType:masonry][i]The Epic of American Civilization[/i][/url] (1932-1934) is a monumental mural by Mexican painter José Clemente Orozco, that was commissioned by Dartmouth College. Set in the reading room of the Baker Library, the mural consists of 24 frescoes, that portray the history of the continent through both the indigenous and the European historical experience. The artist used the symmetrical structure of the reading room’s east and west wing to create historical and cultural parallels between the pre-Hispanic conquest in the east wing, and the post-conquests civilizations represented in the west wing.

Orozco begins the story of Ancient America with the arrival of [i]Quetzalcoatl[/i], a deity that brings a Golden Age to the continent. Accordingly, the mural with[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/departure-of-quetzalcoatl-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934] [i]The departure of Quetzalcoatl[/i][/url] marks the decline of the ancient world, and later its destruction in the fresco [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-8-the-prophecy-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]The Prophecy[/i][/url], that depicts the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. In the west wing, Modern America starts with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-13-cortez-and-the-cross-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934]advent of the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés[/url], who began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Cortés serves as Quetzalcoatl’s anti-hero counterpart: he also establishes a new society, but the subsequent panels show this world as dark and bleak. The panels [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-15-anglo-america-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Anglo-America[/i][/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-16-hispano-america-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Hispano-America[/i][/url] emphasize the different destructive forces of modernity. In [i]Anglo-America[/i], the figures stand in a neat and orderly circle, but they seem devoid of humanity as they stare at a space at the center of the panel. On the other hand, [i]Hispano-America[/i] is a chaotic, bloody scene that shows a revolutionary hero (likely Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata) leading a battle against the rich and the military.

The layout of the mural invites the comparison between the ancient and the modern world, highlighting themes of human conflict, self-sacrifice, and regeneration. For example, the panel [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-3-ancient-human-sacrifice-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Ancient Human Sacrifice[/i][/url] that depicts the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/aztec-art]Aztec[/url] ritual of human sacrifice is directly opposite the panel [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jose-clemente-orozco/panel-18-modern-human-sacrifice-the-epic-of-american-civilization-1934][i]Modern Human Sacrifice[/i][/url], which shows the skeletal figure of an unknown fallen soldier. The artist establishes a clear analogy between these two panels: the religious monument is replaced by the war monument in the background, and the Aztec priest becomes a politician in the modern world. In the mural, the use of pictorial space reflects the artist’s political message. This spatial contrast is most evident in the final group of panels called [url [i]Modern Industrial Man[/i]. These panels indicate that the future of civilization will largely be determined by the relationship between man and industry. The left panel suggests a negative conclusion in which the industry could potentially crush or imprison the modern man. This sentiment is enhanced through the tight composition: the workers are huddled together as they pull two large steel beams that burst into the foreground. The right panel represents a better, more harmonious outcome, in which the men work together to erect a skyscraper. Here, the composition is more balanced, and the man seems to be in command of the industry. In 2013, [i]The Epic of American Civilization[/i] was designated as a National Historic Landmark."
Catharsis,Orozco Jose Clemente,Muralism,symbolic painting,"The mural [i]Catharsis[/i] (1934) decorates the walls of the Palace of Fine Art in Mexico City. Orozco presents there a dystopian vision of humanity, plagued by conflict, decay, and destruction. In particular, he highlights a world ravaged by industrialization and war: the backdrop is a chaotic scene of agitated protesters, men engaging in combat among piles of cogwheels, weapons, and machinery. The most prominent figure is the laughing prostituted woman, provocatively lying on her back left of the center of the mural. Orozco also incorporates disembodied heads of other prostituted women in the foreground, their grimacing faces are painted with garish makeup.

The incorporation of prostituted women in a public commission for a prominent cultural institution reflects the multiple layers of Orozco’s social and political critique in [i]Catharsis[/i]. In the context of European literary and artistic avant-garde, the figure of the prostituted woman is a motif that represents the female body as both an object of male desire and a commodity. The motif embodied the temporal nature and commodified social relations that characterized the experience of modernity and industrialization. This interpretation is supported by some of Orozco’s preparatory sketches, in which the prostitute’s head resembles a bag of coins suggesting that the figure represents the ultimate commodity fetish.

[i]Catharsis[/i] was the first public fresco the artist created after his seven yearlong stay in the United States, and it presented Orozco’s artistic development during his time abroad. The mural reflects the artist’s time in New York: he was influenced by the city’s architecture, for instance, the collapsed steel girder resembles a Manhattan skyscraper. Some have suggested that cinema was another inspiration for [i]Catharsis[/i], specifically the German expressionist film [i]Metropolis[/i] (1927) directed by Fritz Lang – a film Orozco saw while he was living in New York. [i]Catharsis[/i] shares aesthetic and thematic similarities with Lang’s film: [i]Metropolis[/i] also presents dystopian modernity that reveals anxieties relating to technology and mass uprisings. While Lang’s film reconciles the conflicts of capital and labor, Catharsis does not offer a potential solution. Instead, Orozco demonstrates his skeptical attitude toward technological developments and mass mobilization.

It is possible that the figure of the prostituted woman was inspired by the robot Maria in [i]Metropolis[/i]. In the film, the robotic Maria uses her sexuality to inspire an uprising and is later burned at the stake by the same masses. Therefore, Maria is also a signifier of the rioting mob. Accordingly, the prostituted woman in [i]Catharsis[/i] can also be interpreted as a symbol of Mexico’s ten-year revolution – events that the artist experienced and chronicled firsthand. Orozco was deeply critical of the new political regime in post-revolutionary Mexico; thus, the figure of the prostituted woman can be understood as a defiled symbol of corruption. This was a common trope, political satirists in opposition papers often used the administration’s social and economic links to 'high-class prostitutes' to expose their misconduct and corruption. For Orozco, the mural was an opportunity to condemn the hypocrisy and of the ruling regime in a public space in front of a national audience."
Dive Bomber and Tank,Orozco Jose Clemente,Muralism,symbolic painting,"In 1940, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York commissioned Orozco to paint the mural [i]Dive Bomber and Tank[/i] (1940) for the important exhibition [i]Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art[/i]. This indicated the growing interest and emphasis placed on mural painting in the context of Mexican art. The mural was painted in the hall of the Museum over a short period of ten days. Orozco painted most of the mural in front of the public, making it a performance of sorts.

[i]Dive Bomber and Tank[/i] represents the wreckage and destruction of modern warfare: from the top center of the painting, there is a tail of a fallen plane, an element that stands out because of its red color. Large structures resembling wings emerge from the central wreckage, while tank tracks appear on the lower left. In the large pile of machinery, viewers can identify human remains like the legs pointing out on the right side of the mural, and the three large masklike faces pierced by spikes and tangled in chains on the lower half of the mural. The painting serves as a universal message against violence. Some have suggested that Orozco emulated the model set by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-silvers/guernica-photomosaic-mounted-on-aluminum][i]Guernica[/i][/url] (1937), which at the time was exhibited at the MoMA as part of its American tour. Picasso’s monumental painting became a representative example of the aesthetic of a modernist painting that addressed social and political themes in the late 1930s. Painted in 1940, during World War II, Orozco’s imagery refers to the current events of the time. The artist however insisted that the mural was not a political statement and said: “I simply paint the life that is going on at the present—what we are and what the world is at this moment. That is what modern art is.”

The mural is made up of six portable fresco panels that are meant to be interchangeable. At first, Orozco struggled with the idea of a portable fresco, complaining that frescos are too delicate to be moved. The decision to divide the mural into six panels was based on practical reasons, the museum wanted the exhibition to travel, and portable panels were a suitable solution. In the August 1940 issue of the MoMA Bulletin, Orozco suggested six distinct arrangements for the presentation of the mural. Some of these configurations create more abstract compositions, which result in a more ambiguous image than the standard arrangement. The different arrangements of the mural create multiple meanings, which the artist explained in the Bulletin: “The order of inter-relationships may stay the same in any other order, and unexpected and expected possibilities may appear. Suppose we change the actual order of the plastic vaults in the Sistine Chapel…” The art historian, James Oles explains that the stylistic and physical fragmentation in the fresco serves as an allegory for the fragmentation of war. Accordingly, Orozco’s apocalyptic image can be understood as a general condemnation of violence caused by war."
Self-Portrait as a Nurse,Beckmann Max,Verism,self-portrait,"Beckmann served in the medical services in eastern Prussia, then in Flanders and at Strasbourg. He was a witness to the first mustard gas attacks around Ypres. At Courtrai, he was present at operations that surgeons attempted on the wounded and made detailed drawings of them. His self portrait is built around three elements: the eye that scrutinises, the hand that draws, and the red cross. There is hardly any colour. A few months later, Beckmann was sent home to Germany after suffering a serious mental breakdown. He sought refuge in Frankfurt where he slowly took up painting again.

""On my left the shooting had the sharp explosion of the infantry artillery, on my right could be heard the sporadic cannon shots thundering from the front, and up above the sky was clear and the sun bright."" (Max Beckmann)"
Night,Beckmann Max,Expressionism,genre painting,"""This is surely one of the most gruesome pictures ever painted. Other artists, usually motivated by the higher purposes of patriotism or pacifism, have shown the disasters of war, suppression, and martyrdom; torture and pain are often represented as the just deserts of sinners tumbling into hell, and the roasting and beheading of saints are depicted to serve the greater glory of God. But Beckmann sees no purpose in the suffering he shows; there is no glory for anybody, no compensation, no gloating over justice accomplished-only enseless pain, and cruelty for its own sake. Beckmann blames human nature as such, and there seems to be no physical escape from this overwhelming self-accusation. Victims and aggressors alike are cornered. There is no exit.

""And yet, strangely, the composition is visually satisfying: it is jointed as by a master carpenter. That is the cruelest aspect of this work; it presents utter orderliness, as if to say: This is the way things are supposed to be, this is ""regularity."" Not only the design, with its parallels and complementary angles, demonstrates this perverted ""law and order""; the colors, too, appear well spaced and thoughtfully distributed. The woman in the right foreground may be wearing a blue corset because the tongue of the strangled man in the upper left turned blue and the painter needed a color-equilibrium. The torturer's tie may be yellow in order to correspond to the yellow wax of the candles.

""Beckmann has abandoned the Christian symbolism he used in previous works. There is no salvation in sight. One may consider the tiny window cross in the darkness outside as a symbol of hope, but otherwise the pressure in the tight little torture chamber is without relief.

""This is one moment in one attic in Germany at the end of World War I. There is no past and no future. The phonograph blares in order to blot out the cries of anguish. Its tune emphasizes the newsreel actuality of this happening: this is the present, this is the world.

""The complex psychological situations are boiled down to simple formulas. The young woman performing an involuntary split is menaced by the candle. The woman on the right, nonchalantly swept off her feet, will be unable to prevent the rape. The monkey-like sadist in the middle accomplishes his torture with scientific coolness, as if to test the degree of pain that a human being can stand. Only the dog on the left considers outside help as a possibility: he directs his howling away from the center, believing that there is somebody, something outside the confines of the frame. But he is not rational, of course!

""The foreground shows, for the first time in Beckmann's oeuvre, the pair of candles which he later used again and again in still lifes and triptychs: one has fallen and given up its ghost; the other carries bravely on. It is as if the artist wanted to leave one glimmer of hope, one little flickering light to negate the whole of darkness.""

Lackner, Stephan. Max Beckmann (Master of the Art Series). Harry N Abrams; New Ed edition (April 1991)"
Death and Ascension of St. Francis (detail),Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"In 2011 art restorers have discovered the figure of a devil hidden in Death and Ascension of St. Francis fresco by Giotto in the Basilica of St Francis in Assisi. The Satanic image went unnoticed for more than 700 years because it is artfully hidden in the folds of a cloud and is invisible from ground level. Until now it was thought that the first painter to use clouds in this way was Andrea Mantegna, with a painting of St Sebastian from 1460, in which high up in the sky there's a cloud from which a knight on horseback emerges. Now we know that Giotto was the first to use this technique. The master may have painted it to spite someone he knew by portraying him as a devil in the painting."
Adoration of the Magi,Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"This is a portion of the cycle of frescoes in the Arena Chapel, which is one of Giotto’s most renowned works. The scene depicts adorers greeting the baby Jesus, employing Giotto’s techniques such as the draping of cloth and the emotion on the faces of the figures in the scene, as well as the use of three-dimensional techniques, helping the viewers place themselves in the scene. One of the most interesting components of this fresco is the Star of Bethelehem in the form of a comet shooting through the sky. It is thought that Giotto was inspired to paint this Star in this form due to a 1301 viewing of Halley’s Comet."
Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ),Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"This fresco beautifully exemplifies Giotto’s break with Byzantine techniques. He creates a highly emotional story with the combination of elements of traditional Byzantine paintings, such as the dimensional layout and iconography, with his stylized faces showing an emotional response to the death of Christ. The result pulls the viewer into the scene by inviting them to witness the pain and anguish of the Lamentation. You can almost hear the sobs of the women and the shrieks from the angels above. This realistic depiction of emotion on human faces set him apart from other artists of his day, turning Christ and his followers into real human beings with real emotion."
The Arrest of Christ (Kiss of Judas),Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"In this portion of the fresco cycle from the Arena Chapel, you can almost feel the energy in the air. Jesus and Judas stand in the middle of he painting, surrounded by followers and enemies of Jesus. The commotion seems to be just beginning, and as Judas reaches up to give Jesus a kiss, the figures almost look as if they will jump out of the art and begin fighting. This fresco is a great example of the way in which Giotto draped his figures is realistically full heavy cloth, and created real human emotions on the faces of his figures. Each person seems to be asking a different question: Will Judas kiss Jesus? What will happen next?"
Adoration of the Magi,Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"This is a portion of the cycle of frescoes in the Arena Chapel, which is one of Giotto’s most renowned works. The scene depicts adorers greeting the baby Jesus, employing Giotto’s techniques such as the draping of cloth and the emotion on the faces of the figures in the scene, as well as the use of three-dimensional techniques, helping the viewers place themselves in the scene. One of the most interesting components of this fresco is the Star of Bethelehem in the form of a comet shooting through the sky. It is thought that Giotto was inspired to paint this Star in this form due to a 1301 viewing of Halley’s Comet."
Madonna in Maest (Ognissanti Madonna),Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"Giotto was commissioned by the Ognissanti, or All-Saints, Church in Florence to create this screen painting, and it the only panel painting that has been universally accepted as his. As an altarpiece, the painting itself is vary large, over 10 feet tall. Scholars argue as to whether the piece would have been used as a choir screen, where it would have been more visible to the audience, or if it was used as the main altar of the church, in which case it would have been more visible to the brothers of the order. The piece is also indicative of Giotto’s unique technique of creating realistic three-dimensional faces and the draping of cloth upon the figures in the painting."
The Crucifixion,Giotto,Proto Renaissance,religious painting,"The images depicted in this painting are so solidly three dimensional that it seems as if you could reach out and touch them; the tears on the faces of the grieving women look as if they will fall onto the viewer. In this painting, Giotto beautifully illustrates his ability to combine aspects of traditional iconography with the flawless realism for which he was so famous. Giotto shows off his talent by draping the clothing lightly over the crucified Jesus, whose loincloth lightly sits upon his body, and drapes down across his legs as his body sinks down on the cross."
View from the Dunes with Beach and Piers,Mondrian Piet,Neo-Impressionism,landscape,"In this piece, Mondrian’s style is much more fearlessly non-representational. As one of his earlier works, it gives an inkling as to the extent to which the artist was willing to abstract realistic forms in order to suit his own artistic tastes. During the time this painting was created, Mondrian began developing his philosophical ideas on theosophy and anthroposophy, two spiritual movements which allowed Mondrian to see painting as a search for spiritual knowledge within oneself. Although his earlier works depicted dim figures or abstracted colors, his search for spiritual enlightenment within and throughout his paintings was to lead through a pathway of more abstract forms."
Avond (Evening): The Red Tree,Mondrian Piet,Neo-Impressionism,landscape,"One of Mondrian’s earliest paintings, this was the first in which he implemented his color palette of red, blue and yellow, the three primary colors. Also as one of his earlier paintings, it was still a clearly representational form of a tree. As a budding artist, Mondrian began painting simple pastoral landscapes of his home country, and these paintings evolved from those beginning artistic ideas. In the abstraction of the color of the tree and the simple design, Mondrian’s aesthetic style is already present in this simple landscape. This post-impressionistic piece was only a stepping stone in the artist’s development into his ideal form of neo-plasticism."
The Gray Tree,Mondrian Piet,Cubism,landscape,"Mondrian also experimented with other art forms before settling on his own neo-plastic form, including post-impressionism, pointillism, and cubism, the latter of which this is an example. This piece contains interlocking blocks, which form together in the shape of a tree. But unlike cubist artists from whom he took his cue, such as Picasso and Georges Braque, Mondrian had yet to merge his artistic style with his spiritual pursuits, and as such this was only one of a few of such cubist experiments. Mondrian still had a few years to go before he would begin to fins his real voice as an artist, although one could argue that his style was ever-changing, culminating in his masterpieces in his later years of life."
Composition No.10,Mondrian Piet,Neoplasticism,abstract,"In Composition Number 10, Mondrian had reached the full development of his neo-plastic, non-representational form. Many of his paintings contained the basic elements of an interlocking grid of black lines and blocks of the three primary colors. Although the elements were few, he changed the structure of each of the elements in such a way that he was able to create a different aesthetic from each. It was in this later period of his work that Mondrian work until his hands blistered or he made himself cry. During this time, he was also rearranging and painting his Manhattan studio apartment in a similar grid and block pattern, which he changed and re-painted upon completion off certain canvases or projects."
Broadway Boogie Woogie,Mondrian Piet,Neoplasticism,abstract,"Considered Mondrian’s masterpiece, Broadway Boogie Woogie is a shimmering combination of multi-colored grid lines, complete with blocks of color, all in the primary palette. This piece represents another development in the unique style of the artist, which may have been the most profound. After the abandonment of representational forms in 1913 and the reconciliation of his spiritual concerns with his aesthetic, Mondrian had finally developed the transition of solid black lines to lines consisting of multi-colored, vibrant hues, creating an entirely new feeling. This painting represents Mondrian’s seminal work as an artist, and unlike much of his work, is not entirely non-representational. One can see the grid of the Manhattan city streets and feel the beat of the boogie woogie music of which Mondrian was so fond."
Tableau No. IV - Lozenge Composition,Mondrian Piet,Neoplasticism,abstract,"Piet Mondrian intended his abstract or so-called ""neo-plastic"" paintings to express his fundamentally spiritual notion that universal harmonies preside in nature. The horizontal and vertical elements of his compositions, assiduously calibrated to produce a balanced asymmetry, represented forces of opposition that parallel the dynamic equilibrium at work in the natural world. By 1921 Mondrian had distilled his compositions into black lines that intersect at right angles, defining rectangles painted only in white or gray and the three primary colors.

In 1918 the artist turned one of these square canvases 45 degrees to rest ""on point,"" doing so without rotating the linear elements within the composition. Approximately three years later he merged that format with the elemental color scheme of his mature works to produce this monumental painting, the earliest of the neo-plastic diamond or lozenge compositions. Repainted around 1925, when the black lines were thickened, this picture relates to several other works of the 1920s, where color is restricted to the periphery. Mondrian said the diamond compositions were about cutting, and indeed the sense of cropping here is emphatic. Forms are incomplete, sliced by the edge of the canvas, thus implying a pictorial continuum that extends beyond the physical boundary of the painting."
The Feast of the Gods,Bellini Giovanni ,High Renaissance,religious painting,"The Feast of the Gods is an oil painting by Giovanni Bellini, with substantial additions by Titian, who added all the landscape to the left and centre. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for his camerino d'alabastro ('chamber of alabaster') in the Castello Estense, Ferrara. It is one of the few mythological pictures by Bellini, who completed it in 1514. After his death soon afterwards (1516), Titian probably modified the landscape on the left to match it to his The Bacchanal of the Andrians (1518–1523), also in Alfonso's camerino. A more thorough reworking in about 1529 added more landscape, adding the mountain behind the figures.

The scene depicted conflates two episodes in Ovid's Fasti. Priapus, on the right, is attempting to seduce the sleeping nymph Lotis, but is prevented from success by the bray of Silenus' donkey. Around are the drunken Gods: Jupiter has an eagle next to him, Poseidon is caressing Cybele and Ceres, while Hermes is languidly lying on a barrel. The boy with vine-leaves on his head is an unusually young depiction of Bacchus. It is thought that Bellini initially painted the figures as mortals, following a misleading translation of Ovid (the so-called Ovidio volgarizzato), and had to re-paint them with the attributes of the Olympian gods."

Signed E.L. Weeks
Oil on canvas
10 x 12¼ inches (25.4 x 30.5 cm)
Framed: 13¼ x 16 inches (33.5 x 40.6 cm)

Painted circa 1880, this is a study for Weeks' important painting Interior of La Torre des Infantas [oil on canvas, 32 x 40 inches], which was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1882 and was most recently sold at Christie's, New York on April 19, 2006.

Weeks described the exhibited painting as ""an attempt at rendering one of [Washington] Irving's Legends of the Alhambra, 'The Three Moorish Princesses'- and the interior itself is the identical spot where the --- was laid. I have attempted a restoration of the original color as the arabesque work is now partially destroyed."" (Letter from Edwin Lord Weeks to George Corliss, 6 September 1882; Archives of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts).

One of the best known legends of the Alhambra was that of the three captive princesses, in which a tyrannical Moorish king fathered beautiful triplet daughters, Zayda, Zorayda, and Zorahayda, by his young Spanish wife, whose Christianity he had forced her to renounce. To protect them from suitors when they became of ""a marriagable age,"" as Irving describes it, the king imprisoned the three princesses in a tower in a palatial room, connected to the world beyond only by a window with a view across a ravine toward the gardens of the Generalife on a nearby hill. Entranced by three captive Christian Spanish cavaliers, whom they could see from their window, the princesses eventually conspired with their duenna to elope with the virile and handsome young men, as they themselves fled their Muslim captors. At the last moment, one princess decided to remain behind, as her two sisters lowered themselves out of the great window on a rope ladder and galloped off with their suitors to a new life in Christian Spain. Tragically, the third princess, too timid to join her sisters in escape, pined away in the tower and died at an early age.

This painting will be included in the forthcoming Weeks catalogue raisonné being prepared by Dr. Ellen K. Morris. We are grateful to Dr. Morris for her assistance in the cataloguing of this study."

Girl with a White Dog,Freud Lucian,Expressionism,nude painting (nu),"Typical of Freud's early period, Girl with a White Dog was created using a sable brush, which he used to apply the paint with linear precision, almost like a drawing. The subtle shading evokes a host of textures exuding softness, warmth, and the absence of immediate tension. The robe has slipped off the sitter's shoulder, exposing her right breast. Coupled with the absent stare of the woman and the dog, the muted colors and faint contours give this composition an overall flatness.

The sitter is Kitty Garman, Freud's first wife, and a noted beauty whose father was artist Jacob Epstein. The dog was one of two bull terriers they were given as a wedding gift.

Freud painted many portraits of Kitty during their brief marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his chronic infidelities. A weariness in the sitter's expression, the deep hollows under her eyes and the self-supporting gesture of the hand under the left breast hint at her discontent, despite this moment of calm. The analytic distance that came to characterize Freud's brilliance as an observer is reinforced by the absence of a name in the title, despite his intimate connection to the subjects. He was able to see certain things better because he remained aloof."
Hotel Bedroom,Freud Lucian,Expressionism,"genre painting, self-portrait","Settling in Paris in 1952, Freud painted many portraits, including Hotel Bedroom (1954), which features a woman lying in a bed with white sheets pulled up to her shoulders. Her left hand rests on her cheek, and her gaze is fixed on a faraway place. In sharp contrast, a standing man is standing behind her and staring at her. His dark form looms over her menacingly, silhouetted against the sunlight. Other windows in the building across the street are visible in the background.

The man is Freud himself, and the woman is Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood, the Guinness ale heiress with whom he eloped in 1952 after the divorce from his first wife. At the time they were staying at the Hotel La Louisiane, and the work reflects the anxiety and tension in their relationship, which had already begun to unravel. She would soon leave him, and the distraught Freud, while having many more relationships, would never marry again. This painting is among the works that Freud exhibited it at the Venice Biennale when he was invited to serve as the representative of Britain in 1954, a great honor. Like this and other early portraits by the artist, the work has a flat, drawing-like quality. Here, however, the body of the artist is a black hole, threatening to suck the light out of the rest of the picture. The artist's standing pose also seems to predict a turning point in his working method. This is the last portrait he completed while sitting down. From that point on, he chose to stand while painting. One of his more narrative works, it exemplifies the autobiographical self-absorption and detachment associated with his later work."
Red Haired Man on a Chair,Freud Lucian,Expressionism,genre painting,"This is one of the earliest examples of Freud's mature style. Unconventional poses were one of Freud's specialties. The subject matter is conventional, but the pose is one rarely, if ever, seen in traditional Western portraiture. The subject is Tim Behrens, a friend and student at Slade School of Art, where Freud was a visiting teacher. The work's generic title, giving no hint of the specifics of the sitter or the setting, reflects the consistent, clinical detachment with which Freud approached all subjects, no matter what their relationship to him. Red Haired Man on a Chair (1962) depicts Behrens perched with his knees tucked under him, dressed in a gray suit, and with his brown shoes resting on a chair that appears to tilt toward us. The wooden post and discarded pile of cloths behind him indicate that the environment is the painting studio. At this point in his career, Freud made a transition from sable to hog-hair brushes which allowed both greater control and an ability to apply broad strokes in the heavily impastoed style one sees here.

It is clear that Freud has reached a new level of sophistication. Witness, for example, the linear tension between the figure and the post inches away, giving the appearance that if he leans a little more to the left he might actually touch it. Witness, too, the relationship between the vertical figure and the horizontal line of rags in the background, which forms a cross. Freud was not remotely religious, and certainly not Catholic, so this is a clever reference to the pose his student was holding, which was wildly uncomfortable and underscores his student's position as a martyr for the cause of great art. The observation, more sadistic than empathetic, characterizes Freud's approach to the human form, in particular his ability to suspend empathy with the sitter in order to observe him or her more closely. It is also one of the first examples of the appearance of rags strewn about in loose piles, a common compositional device in Freud's later portraits."
Annabel Sleeping,Freud Lucian,Expressionism,genre painting,"[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto][/url]This artwork was painted between 1987 - 1988, when Freud was already an established artist. The portrayed woman is one of his two daughters from his marriage with Kitty Garman (a daughter of a sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-epstein]Jacob Epstein[/url]).

What is quite innovative in Freud’s approach to the depicted subject, is the perspective. The artist represents a lying body completely turned away from us, so we cannot see the facial expression - but still, the painting is quite expressive. The body is curled up in the fetal position, which can be interpreted as a reaction to a physical or psychological trauma. Representing his sleeping daughter like this, Freud may be suggesting that he is a helpless observer of her mental and emotional pain. He also is putting the viewer into a position of a voyeur who intrudes a woman’s personal space and gets the insight of how she feels. Besides, this painting could be read in a feminist key - a woman is expressing her trauma only when she is sleeping, only when she is unaware that others are watching.

In his paintings, Freud demonstrates a tangibility of humans - be it their emotional pain and struggle, or be it naturalism in depicting of their bodies. This tangibility of Annabel is shown in a brute physicality of her feet. The artist emphasizes small details, like motion of muscles and texture of the skin. He de-idealizes the human body, breaking with the tradition of representing a female figure as a beautiful and flawless object,  and insists on the corporeality of all bodies. This de-idealization reminds us of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio]Caravaggio[/url]’s realism, which can be seen in his works such as [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/madonna-of-loreto]Madonna of Loreto[/url][/i], [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/entombment]Entombment of Christ[/url][/i] or [i][url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caravaggio/crucifixion-of-saint-peter-1601]Crucifixion of Saint Peter[/url][/i]. In a similar manner, Caravaggio’s depiction of saints’ dirty feet highlights the imperfection of the human body and human nature."
Man with Leg Up,Freud Lucian,Expressionism,nude painting (nu),"This is one of Freud's many paintings of the Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery. Freud's friends introduced them, hoping that Bowery's flamboyant style, which included bright colors and sequins, would inspire Freud to abandon his usual drab palette. Being obstinate, Freud asked Bowery to shave his whole body. Freud saw Bowery's muscular legs as his best feature, and often showcases them in a series of unusually unselfconscious and passive poses that thwart the conventions of male portraiture.

In Man with Leg Up, Bowery lies on the floor with his legs splayed. One leg rests on the bed while the other bends underneath him, as if keeping him from sliding down the floor, which tilts toward us. Nearly all elements in this scene, from the supine pose to the splayed legs indicates vulnerability. Exaggerated foreshortening makes Bowery's top half appear further away, highlighting the exposure of his hairless groin, which occupies the very center of the picture. Bowery seems at ease with this. His facial features are relaxed. His left arm cradles his head while his right is draped across his chest, regarding us as if to say, ""so what""?

The two men developed a friendship, and Freud continued to paint Bowery over the course of four years, until his death from AIDS in 1994."
Queen Elizabeth II,Freud Lucian,Expressionism,portrait,"Freud painted many portraits of famous people throughout his career. The Queen is perhaps his most powerful and globally recognizable subject. While Freud normally worked large, this composition measures approximately nine and a half by six inches, making it one of his smallest paintings. Nonetheless, it depicts the British monarch as an imposing presence. The entire composition is filled by her face. A sliver of pearls adorns her throat, while atop her white hair is an elaborate, jeweled crown. The symmetrical details in the jewels and hair mark the parameters of the picture, and serve as a kind of psychic boundary for the work. The crown, an item Freud specifically requested she wear for the portrait, dominates the upper border of the picture.

After agreeing to pose for the artist, the Queen met Freud for a sitting in May of 2000. Making an exception from his usual practice of making a studio appointment, Freud traveled for sittings to St. James Palace at the Royal Collection's Friary Court, where she sat for him at the picture conservation studio. The small canvas took over six months to complete and was finally finished in December of 2001. By the time he was ready to paint the crown the Queen, who had other obligations, had run out of time. So a model had to be used. Freud, always a lightning rod for controversy, was accused of painting the Queen in an unflattering and unduly harsh light.

The project sparked debate and got mixed reviews (some saw it as a cheap publicity stunt by an artist with fading talent). Yet in his forthright observation of the Queen's features, one sees a raw intensity Freud had maintained throughout his career and refused to minimize, regardless of his subject. Among the more intriguing interpretations of this portrait, recently discussed by independent art historian Simon Abrahams, is that the Queen is a symbolic stand-in for the artist himself, a kind of alter-ego. The Queen's aging features in this portrait are remarkably similar to those of Freud himself, and the British press complained that the portrait looked nothing like her, adding credence to the theory."
The Skat Players,Dix Otto ,Dada,genre painting,"One of Dix’s early post-war paintings, which displays the harsh reality of the Weimar Germany in the style of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/new-objectivity-neue-sachlichkeit#!#resultType:masonry]New Objectivity[/url] movement, is [i]The Skat Players[/i] painted in 1920. After Germany’s defeat in the First World War, the day-to-day life turned into a grotesque display of mutilated, shell-shocked, and depraved members of society. Dix’s way of getting across his belief of the degrading post-war life was through usage of less symbolism, and more realistic notions, specific for the New Objectivity. The artist wanted to make a clear statement in regard to the damage and destruction the war can do to society, treating the matter in a detached way, showing both a satirical attitude and a serious side of things.

In this painting, Dix presents the war as a gamble, a skat game between the crippled and deformed soldiers, expressing the shocking new reality of that time. Three disfigured soldiers represent the new stereotype of the Weimar Republic: the unemployable and miserable war veterans that are disposed by the working class based society after serving for their country. Without a purpose or a place in life, viewed only as a token of the German defeat, the only thing left for the veterans is playing cards and passing time with fellow soldiers.

Besides giving shape to terror, Dix painted this tableau to illustrate the dehumanizing effects a war has on people, stripping them of all their senses, as the characters are portrayed deaf, blind, burnt, and crippled. The fact that the soldiers have patches and numerous aiding devices sends the viewer into the era of industrialized war. The prosthetics, hearing aids, and glass eyes depict the misuse of technology and industrial progress for the soldiers disabled in the war. To add a personal touch to the artwork, and to show a personal view of the matter, Dix left a small self-portrait within the painting alongside a marking that says [i]unterkiefer prothese marke Dix[/i] meaning 'lower jaw prosthesis brand Dix'.The interesting fact is that Dix left this mark on the soldier that had an Iron Cross decoration, a medal which was awarded to the artist himself during the war, therefore showing empathy toward his subjects and identifying with them."
Frauenkopf,Dix Otto ,,portrait,"'Frauenkopf' (Head of a prostitute), watercolour and Indian ink on paper, 1925.

""The idea of the painting is to truthfully depict prostitution in all its gruesome and dehumanizing effects, to castigate it as a social evil, and to convincingly portray its consequences, which are devastating to body and mind.- (Otto Dix, quoted in: Schmidt, Diether: Otto Dix im Selbstbildnis, Berlin 1981, p. 202.)

His painting mercilessly portrays a bony, angular figure, the face is frozen into a mask under the white face powder and copious rouge, lipstick and eyeshadow. The unkempt, straggly hair flowing down around the face, the low forehead, the protruding chin and the overemphasized thickness of the lips give the countenance a primordial or animalistic quality. In depicting the subject of the harlot, Dix aimed to reduce taboos around the sexual. The artist's interest in the motif stems from his own libidinousness, so Dix paints his own experiences and not mere objects. In 1923, Dix even had to stand trial for these kinds of ""indecent"" works.

Self Portrait,Tintoretto,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),self-portrait,"This dramatically intimate self-portrait announced the arrival of new talent on the Venetian art scene; Tintoretto painted it when he was 30 years old, at the beginning of his career. The picture follows the Venetian portraiture tradition of showing the subject's head emerging from a dark background and making the eyes the focus of attention. 

The starkness of the composition, quite unlike his densely populated narrative paintings, was unprecedented, as the artist provides no details to indicate a place, context, or even his profession as an artist. While many artists depict themselves with the tools of their trade or wearing the finery of a gentleman, Tintoretto represents himself with an intense penetrating gaze, perhaps suggestive of peering into a mirror, and omits his hands, the very means by which the work was created. Tintoretto's gaze is truly captivating, with his head turned over his right shoulder he stares directly out, providing a confrontation with the viewer. The visibly pronounced brushstrokes, appearing as natural highlights on the artist's face from afar, seem as nearly impasto patches of paint on the surface of the composition as one approaches the work. This key feature of Tintoretto's style, found even in his earliest works, helped to set him apart from the more finished brushwork styles of his Venetian contemporaries such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url], and would influence the work of his younger contemporaries and subsequent generations of artists. 

This may be the first autonomous self-portrait in European art to leave the touch of the artist so evident, functioning almost as a signature. The line that extends to the freely painted self-portraits of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent van Gogh[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url] starts here."
The Miracle of St Mark Freeing the Slave,Tintoretto,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"The painting is the first of a series of works that Tintoretto painted in 1548 for the Scuola Grande di San Marco while Marco Episcopi, artist's future father-in-law, was Grand Guardian of the School.

The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearance of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of St Mark against his master's will. The scene takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light. In contrast, the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.

The overall composition of [i]The Miracle of the Slave[/i], although set within an opulent Roman courtyard, is intense with action. Three times the executioner attempted to levy the punishment, and each time the tools have broken before the slave could be harmed. This is the work of Saint Mark, who, in dramatic fashion, descends from heaven in a red robe and billowing orange cape to rescue the slave and spare him the suffering associated with this painful death. This miracle also converts the slave's master at embracing the Christian faith.

The great influence that [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url] had on Tintoretto's artistic style is visible in this work; the robust, muscular figures staged in a variety of complex positions are reminiscent of the Renaissance master. Scholars doubt whether Tintoretto made studies from the sculptural maquettes or other works based on the originals by Michelangelo.

Despite some of the initial criticism Tintoretto received for the speed at which he worked, made evident from the loose and gestural brushwork, this painting had a profound impact on Tintoretto's career. A commission for the Confraternity of Scuola Grande di San Marco brought the artist wide attention, after which he began receiving many commissions. According to Tintoretto's biographers, some members of the confraternity argued against accepting it, enraging the artist, who took it back to his studio. But eventually, the naysayers were discomfited, Tintoretto and his proponents won the day, and the painting was installed to great acclaim. The acceptance of this work was an essential step towards broadening the stylistic range of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/venetian-school]Venetian School[/url]. In addition to the more traditional approaches of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url], here, Tintoretto provided a highly dramatic presentation of a religious subject, which helped to lay the foundation for the future development of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art."
Crucifixion,Tintoretto,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"Tintoretto's most remarkable work is the vast and complex series of fifty canvases painted between 1565 and 1587 for the meeting rooms of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco (a confraternity devoted to combating the plague, a repeated scourge of the Venice.) They illustrate scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin in the upper and lower halls, respectively, and scenes from the Passion - dominated by this colossal [i]Crucifixion[/i] - in the Sala dell' Albergo. The [i]Crucifixion[/i] embodies several critical characteristics of Tintoretto's art. The teeming canvas, full of incident, also recalls several of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url]'s monumental works - indeed, the sheer scale of the canvases sometimes used by these artists required a wealth of detail to fill the large area. The canvas of the [i]Crucifixion[/i] took up an entire wall, and to help him create his intricate series of poses and compositions, Tintoretto made use of numerous small wax models, which he moved around and illuminated from different angles.

In conception and execution, Tintoretto's Christ on the cross is one of the most unusual and compelling scenes of the crucifixion of the 16th century. Instead of focusing on the individuals directly involved in the event, the artist provides us with a panoramic scene of Golgotha, populated by an astonishingly varied throng - including soldiers, executioners, horsemen, tradesmen, onlookers, thieves, and apostles - engaged in all sorts of different activities and movements with almost insect-like urgency. In the process, he explores every aspect of the scene. 

One infrequent feature for Renaissance art is the inclusion of the two thieves in the composition, one being nailed to a cross, the other being raised. All four Gospels relate that two thieves were crucified with Christ. According to Luke, the one on Christ's right rebuked the other, saying that their punishment was deserved whereas Christ was innocent. Christ said to him, ""Today, you shall be with me in Paradise."" The role of the thieves clearly gave Tintoretto a means of filling the vast canvas. But it is also true to say that all his paintings for the Scuola emphasized the humility and mercy of Christ, as well as his links with ordinary sinners, the poor, and the destitute, and the story of the thieves fits nicely into this theme.

In his thought-provoking article on Tintoretto's Crucifixion, published in ""Painters on Painting"" (1969), Brian Robb states that the man who is busily securing the second thief's cross is employing the same techniques and same type of tool (a gimlet) that he himself had observed being used by a Venetian carpenter constructing a jetty. This is not merely a curiosity - it underlines the extent to which Tintoretto's work drew on the life around him, not least the balance and lean and thrust of gondoliers, whose gestures undoubtedly inspired many of the figures' tenuous relation to gravity. In the foreground, on the right, is a man with his back to us, digging; perhaps he is preparing a hole for the stake of the cross, but more particularly, he serves as a striking example of the energy being expressed across the painting.

The raising of the crosses also afforded Tintoretto the opportunity of depicting numerous muscular individuals in vigorous motion, testifying to his interest in the figure drawing of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url], while it also enabled him to introduce two strong diagonals that bring dynamism to the scene and help to create a strong underlying structure. In particular, the diagonals focus attention on the figure of Christ, who is still and calm on his cross - a figure of calm amid the chaos and turmoil below. Under a clouded sky that somehow manages to be at the same time calm and apocalyptic, Christ's body is parallel to the picture-plane, reinforcing the impression of stillness, and he looks with special compassion upon the group at the foot of the cross, which includes the swooning Virgin and also his friends. The group is beautifully painted and brought together in a dignified and rhythmic movement.

Christ is placed very high on the cross, almost at the top of the scene before us. The nails piercing His hands and feet are visible, but little is made of his suffering. The light radiating from Christ's head has physical substance, like wings, and though the head leans forward, it is not drooping with exhaustion but first looking down on the scene around him. Another feature of the scene that is distinctly Venetian is the introduction of vast numbers of people, most of them richly dressed, who have come to witness the event. Men in armor or luxurious clothes and exotic headgear crowd around from all directions, turning the episode into a spectacle (see also Veronese's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/the-marriage-at-cana-1563][i]Wedding Feast at Cana[/i][/url] (1563) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/feast-in-the-house-of-levi-1573][i]Feast in the House of Levi[/i][/url] (1573) for later versions of this 'spectacle' effect.) It is a painting that involves the spectator in the highest degree, especially as details such as the ladder on the left are so close to the picture-plane and the viewer's space. Although the Renaissance color palette is limited, the dusky setting, out of which emerges a pattern of brilliant reds and whites, is reminiscent of some of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]'s early works and is almost certainly designed to take account of the lighting of the room. After Tintoretto's death, Venice had to wait for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giovanni-battista-tiepolo]Giambattista Tiepolo[/url] before it had a master of such stature again."
The Origin of the Milky Way,Tintoretto,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),mythological painting,"One of four paintings based on the myth of Hercules, Tintoretto's [i]The Origin of the Milky Way[/i], depicts the god Jupiter bringing his son Heracles, born of a mortal woman, to nurse from the breast of his wife, the goddess Juno. In a composition which anticipates the drama of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] painting, the artist creates a scene of flustered activity depicting the moment Juno awakens to discover Jupiter's deceit. According to myth, the infant Heracles would obtain immortality through breastfeeding from the goddess. However, as she awakes, Juno draws away in anger causing her milk to spray across the sky, thus forming the Milky Way indicated by an array of stars. From her other breast, milk falls toward Earth, resulting in the creation of beautiful lilies, believed to be part of the original composition (later trimmed down). Below the immortal couple, numerous cupids with bows drawn, symbolize the marital discord and its universal consequences.

The work provides visible proof of Tintoretto's skill as both a draughtsman and colorist. The foreshortening of Jupiter is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giotto]Giotto[/url]'s groundbreaking frescos in the Arena Chapel, the muscular Juno the influence of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url], but the rhythmic arrangement of figures is uniquely Tintoretto. The expert use of color in both the figures and attire relates to Tintoretto's childhood exposure to pigments in his father's workshop as a cloth dyer. The composition is built up from a carefully variegated palette which moves from intense blue to grey in the sky, and from white and gold through to orange, pink and scarlet in the draperies.

[i]The Origin of the Milky Way[/i] is one of many mythological paintings Tintoretto created throughout his long career, though he is best remembered for his religious paintings. This particular series of paintings, commissioned from Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, is an essential indication of the progressive artist's popularity beyond Italy. A mystery surrounds the original impetus for this painting. Some scholars believe it was first painted as a commission for the ""grand guardian"" of the Scuola Grande di San Marco, Tommaso Rangone, who had commissioned other notable works from the artist, including [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/finding-of-the-body-of-st-mark][i]Finding the Body of Saint Mark[/i][/url] (1562). After Rangone's death, the artist reconfigured this painting for the Emperor."
Paradise,Tintoretto,Mannerism (Late Renaissance),religious painting,"In December 1577, a fire broke out on the ground floor of the Doge's Palace in Venice, resulting in serious damage to the decoration, walls, ceilings, and furnishings of various rooms and significantly affecting the structure of the building. So great was the damage that the idea of demolishing the old [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/gothic-art]Gothic[/url] building and replacing it with a new one was seriously considered. After considerable discussion, it was, however, decided to restore the areas affected and to replace the interior decoration. Among the damaged rooms was one of the most celebrated: the Sala del Maggior Consiglio. This large space, whose proportions make it one of the most majestic and imposing in the entire building, was the room where the Great Council met. In the 16th century, the Venetian senators who formed the Council numbered more than 1, 000. The room was used for purposes of legislation and for electing members of the magistracy.

It was decided to restore the room with a flat ceiling divided into sections with decorative, high-relief molding into which paintings would be fitted. The same concept was to be used for the frieze that ran along the two long side walls of the room in which painted portraits of the Doges would be inset. The subject selected to decorate the walls of the room was the Glorification of Venice, depicted through a series of military episodes. Three huge canvases would provide the principal elements in the ceiling. They are a central, rectangular one by Jacopo Tintoretto, depicting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/tintoretto/doge-nicol%C3%B2-da-ponte-receiving-a-laurel-crown-from-venice-1584][i]The City of Venice offering a laurel Wreath to Doge Nicolò da Ponte[/i][/url] (1584) and two flanking, oval ones in which [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese]Veronese[/url] painted an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paolo-veronese/apotheosis-of-venice-1585][i]Allegory of Venice[/i][/url] (1585), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/palma-il-giovane]Palma Giovane[/url] depicted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/palma-il-giovane/venice-crowned-by-victory-1584][i]Venice, crowned by Victory, receiving the conquered Provinces[/i][/url] (1584).

To replace the medieval fresco of around 1365 by Guariento, which had been damaged in the fire, the commission entrusted with devising and overseeing the new decoration organized a competition that may have been convened in 1582. The theme of this new image was the ""Glory of the blessed in Paradise."" Among the painters who took part were Francesco Bassano, Veronese, Palma Giovane, and Tintoretto. The commission gave the project to Veronese and Francesco Bassano, two artists with widely differing styles. However, Veronese's death in 1588 and the fact that Bassano had not started his part by the time of Veronese's death resulted in the project being given to Tintoretto, who was seventy years old by this date.

According to the guidelines established for the competition, the composition had to focus on the Coronation of the Virgin, inspired by Dante's [i]Paradise[/i]. Tintoretto included the blessed and different religious hierarchies among clouds, angels, and cherubim. The principal motif is the Coronation of the Virgin in the upper center, while the Dove of the Holy Spirit forms the axis of this complex composition. The main group, in which Christ leans forward and extends his hand to crown his mother, emerges between numerous heads and figures against the intense yellow of a cloud of glory. The remaining figures in the canvas are arranged in gently curving lines, floating among clouds and stars. Tintoretto has woven in the traditional iconography of the Annunciation scene, where the angel Gabriel announces that Mary will carry the child of God, together with the Last Judgment, implied by the artist with the symbol of the scales. The clouds wrap around the central figures, almost likes ripples in a pond, suggesting the continued reverberations of the church's teachings - especially significant during the time of the Counter-Reformation.

Seen from afar, [i]Paradiso[/i] is nearly an abstract vision composed of rhythmic patterns of light and color. The work represents the culmination of the artist's mastery of sharp contrasts between light and dark in the intensely rendered figures. The dramatic, almost theatrical quality of Tintoretto's scene would lay the foundation for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/baroque]Baroque[/url] art."
Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon,Delaunay Robert,Orphism,"figurative, abstract","Delaunay was fascinated by how the interaction of colors produces sensations of depth and movement, without reference to the natural world. In [i]Simultaneous Contrasts[/i] that movement is the rhythm of the cosmos, for the painting’s circular frame is a sign for the universe, and its flux of reds and oranges, greens and blues, is attuned to the sun and the moon, the rotation of day and night. But the star and planet, refracted by light, go undescribed in any literal way. “[i]The breaking up of form by light creates colored planes[/i],” Delaunay said. “[i]These colored planes are the structure of the picture, and nature is no longer a subject for description but a pretext[/i].” Indeed, he had decided to abandon “[i]images or reality that come to corrupt the order of color[/i].”

The poet Guillaume Apollinaire christened Delaunay’s style [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orphism]Orphism[/url], after Orpheus, the musician of Greek legend whose eloquence on the lyre is a mythic archetype for the power of art. The musicality of Delaunay’s work lay in color, which he studied closely. In fact, he derived the phrase “Simultaneous Contrasts” from the treatise [i]On the Law of the Simultaneous Contrast of Colors[/i], published in 1839 by Michel-Eugène Chevreul. Absorbing Chevreul’s scientific analyses, Delaunay has here gone beyond them into a mystical belief in color, its fusion into unity symbolizing the possibility for harmony in the chaos of the modern world.

Agnus Dei,Zurbaran Francisco de ,Baroque,animal painting,"This votive image was wide-spread in seventeenth-century Spain. It represents an Agnus Dei or “Lamb of God”, in allusion to Christ's sacrificial death to save humanity. The straightforward composition consists exclusively of an image of the young animal with its legs bound, lying on a windowsill and brightly light by a single light source. 

Zurbarán made six versions of this subject with small iconographic variations, which indicates that it was relatively successful with his private clients. This is the finest version and it corresponds to his mature period. 
This work was acquired by the Spanish State in 1986."
Self-portrait,Boccioni Umberto,Impressionism,self-portrait,"This Self-Portrait demonstrates Boccioni's style as a student at the Academy in Rome. Although it differs greatly from his mature Futurism, being far softer in its tone and brushwork, he cherished the picture and never sold it during his lifetime. It is typical of the period when he was moving from a style inspired by early Impressionism to a more volumetric approach suggested by study of works by Paul Cézanne."
Self-portrait,Boccioni Umberto,"Divisionism, Impressionism",self-portrait,"In the canvas, which Boccioni painted in 1908 in his studio in Via Adige in Milan, the artists explores for the first time the landscape of the Milanese periphery. He often depicted this motif in the time before his futuristic period as, for example, in the sketch of The City Rising.

The portrait was donated to Brera by Vico Baer, Boccioni’s friend and collector, in 1951."
The City Rises,Boccioni Umberto,"Divisionism, Futurism",cityscape,"The City Rises is considered by many to be the very first truly Futurist painting. Boccioni took a year to complete it and it was exhibited throughout Europe shortly after it was finished. It testifies to the hold that Neo-Impressionism and Symbolism maintained on the movement's artists even after Futurism was inaugurated in 1909. It was not until around 1911 that Boccioni adapted elements of Cubism to create a distinct Futurist style. Nevertheless, The City Rises does capture the group's love of dynamism and their fondness for the modern city. A large horse races into the foreground while several workers struggle to gain control of it, suggesting a primeval conflict between humanity and beasts. The horse and figures are blurred, communicating rapid movement while other elements, such as the buildings in the background, are rendered more realistically. At the same time, the perspective teeters dramatically in different sections of the painting."
States of Mind I: The Farewells,Boccioni Umberto,Futurism,figurative,"The Farewells was the first of Boccioni's three-part series, States of Mind, which has long been seen as one of the high points of the Futurist style in painting. The focal point of the picture is provided by movement itself - the locomotive, the airplane, the automobile: modern machines that gave new meaning to the word ""speed."" In this work, set in a train station, Boccioni captures the dynamism of movement and chaos, depicting people being consumed by, or fused with, the steam from the locomotive as it whizzes past."
The Street Enters the House,Boccioni Umberto,"Cubism, Expressionism",genre painting,"The geometric elements and the perspectival distortion in The The Street Enters the House demonstrate the influence of Expressionism and Cubism on Boccioni. According to the original catalog entry for the work, ""The dominating sensation is that which one would experience on opening a window: all life, and the noises of the street rush in at the same time as the movement and the reality of the objects outside."""
Unique Forms of Continuity in Space,Boccioni Umberto,Cubism,sculpture,"Although Boccioni was a painter first and foremost, his brief forays into sculpture are significant. The speed and fluidity of movement - what Boccioni called ""a synthetic continuity"" - is brilliantly captured in this bronze piece, with the human figure gliding through space, almost as if man himself is becoming machine, moving head-on into forceful winds. Possibly in homage to Auguste Rodin's Walking Man (1877-8), and the classical Greek statue Nike of Samothrace (220-190 B.C.), Boccioni left the sculpture without arms."
The Charge of the Lancers,Boccioni Umberto,Futurism,genre painting,"The Charge of the Lancers is the only known work by Boccioni that is devoted exclusively to the theme of war. Being a collage, Charge was also a rare departure for the artist in terms of medium. In previous works, Boccioni had used the figure of the horse as a symbol for work, but in this collage the horse becomes a symbol of war and natural strength, since it appears to be overcoming a horde of German bayonets. If, in fact, Boccioni was establishing the brute strength of the horse over man-made weapons, it would suggest a slight departure from the Futurist principles of Marinetti. This work also eerily prefigures Boccioni's own death from having been trampled by a horse."
Lamentation of Christ,van der Weyden Rogier ,Northern Renaissance,religious painting,"The work is perhaps the ""altarpiece [with] Our Lord's sepulchre [...] and other five figures"" which appear in the inventory made in 1492 at the death of Lorenzo de' Medici, and which decorated his Villa at Careggi since as early as 1482. The panel was thus one of the works commissioned by the Medici to van der Weyden, including the Medici Madonna now at Städel of Frankfurt, which has been also assigned to the artist's trip to Italy in 1450. Another hypothesis is that the panel was part of a lost triptych painted for Lionello d'Este of Ferrara, and mentioned in 1449, or that it was the painting described by Giorgio Vasari as Hans Memling's.

The panel adopts the same scheme in Fra Angelico's Pietà for the predella of the San Marco Altarpiece (1438–1443), now at the Alte Pinakothek of Munich, confirming that the Flemish artist visited Florence during his pilgrimage in Italy of 1449-1450, as confirmed by De viribus illustribus by Bartolomeo Facio (c. 1456). The work was later part of the collections of cardinal Carlo de' Medici, being moved to the Uffizi Gallery in 1666. Filippo Baldinucci described it as a work by Albrecht Dürer. In 1989 it was still assigned to Hans Memling by some scholars, but in 1992 a 1992 a reflex photography showed the underlying drawing, which was clearly executed by van der Weyden.

The painting has a rectangular shape, and shows Christ being buried with the weeping Mary and John the Evangelist holding his hands. The corpse is supported by a richly dressed Joseph of Arimathea (identified by some as a portrait of Cosimo de' Medici) and by Nicodemus, perhaps a self-portrait of the artist. A kneeling Mary Magdalene is depicted in the low foreground.

The composition is similar to Angelico's Pietà, but the scene here is more complex and crowded, with less geometrically ordered lines and more anguished faces. The use of oil paint also allowed van der Weyden to obtain deeper colors and a more brilliant light. The attention to details is also typical of the early Netherlandish painting school."
Judith,Giorgione,High Renaissance,religious painting,"Once falsely attributed to Raphael, Judith is Giorgione’s interpretation of the Judith and Holofernes theme. Like Giorgione’s Castelfranco Madonna, it was badly restored in the late 19th century, which distorted the image, leaving the artist’s intentions unclear. In 1893, the painting was transferred from canvas to a panel, and in 1967, it was successfully restored to its original beauty. Restoration, complete in 1971, revealed the tower and hilly landscape in the background which had previously been covered by a thick layer of varnish. The painting is now held in the Russian Hermitage Museum, which came in possession of it in 1772."
Madonna and Child with Saints Liberale and Francis (The Castelfranco Madonna),Giorgione,High Renaissance,religious painting,"After it was stolen in 1972, this painting is now safely housed in the Cathedral of Castelfranco Veneto, Giorgione’s hometown. It was commissioned by the military leader Tuzio Costanzo, in memory of his son, who died while serving the Republic of Venice. The Costanzo coats of arms decorates the altar, and it has been conjectured that Nicasius, on the left of the painting, is actually a portrait of Matteo, whose tomb now lies directly below the painting in the Cathedral. The painting has suffered bad restorations, but was safely and accurately restored in 2002-2003 in Venice, before being returned to its home in Castelfranco."
The Tempest,Giorgione,High Renaissance,genre painting,"Apart from his larger commissioned works, most of what Giorgione painted was smaller paintings, designed for personal collectors to keep in their homes. This is one such piece, measuring 33 by 29 inches, commissioned by Gabriele Vendramin, a Venetian noble. It is said to be the first landscape in Western painting, and its symbolic implications are up to determination, as there have been many differing interpretations of its meaning. While some interpretations go so far as to indicate that the man and the woman represent Adam and Eve, the sucking babe Cain, and God in the form of lighting and the coming storm, others see no meaning in the work, and state that Giorgione had no particular story in mind while he was completing the work."
The Three Philosophers,Giorgione,High Renaissance,genre painting,"This painting was commissioned by a Venetian merchant, Taddeo Contarini, who had an interest in the occult and alchemy. The painting depicts three philosophers: one young, one middle aged, and one old. According to one interpretation, the three figures are said to represent the three stages of human thought: the Renaissance, the age of Muslim academic expansion, and the Middle Ages. Other interpretations include that the philosophers are standing outside Plato’s cave, or that they are the Three Magi, outside the tomb of Jesus.  One of Giorgione’s last works before his death, it is said to have been finished by Sebastiano del Pombo, a Venetian artist who was highly influenced by Giorgione’s style."
Pastoral Concert (Fête champêtre),Giorgione,High Renaissance,allegorical painting,"This work is one of the mysteries of European painting: in spite of its undeniable quality and epochal importance, opinions are divergent concerning both its creator and its theme. It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.

The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of ""Pastorale"" and only subsequently was it given the title ""Fête champêtre"" or ""Concert champêtre"", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.

The female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's ""Poetica"".

The scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music."
The Sleeping Venus,Giorgione,High Renaissance,mythological painting,"Left unfinished at the time of his death, it is generally agreed that the landscape and sky in Sleeping Venus were completed by the Renaissance painter Titian. The choice of a single nude woman marked a revolution in art, as it was an unprecedented element, especially the semi-erotic positioning of the arms, one of which is raised, the other being placed near the groin. A further innovation in this painting is Giorgione’s use of a landscape to frame the sleeping goddess, as he was the first painter to widely paint landscapes with figures. The painting is now held in the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden, Germany."
Portrait of a Venetian Gentleman,Giorgione,High Renaissance,portrait,"The expression of calculating, almost cruel, appraisal—amplified by his closed fist—gives this man an aggressive air, but we do not know his identity. The inscription on the parapet does not help. These letters, VVO, have been interpreted as a form of the Latin vivo (in life). This would suggest that the portrait was painted from life and that it confers on both subject and painter a measure of immortality. It may more likely, however, be an abbreviation of a humanist motto, perhaps virtus vincit omnia (virtue conquers all).

Like other paintings associated with Giorgione, this one presents difficulties of attribution. Both Titian and Sebastiano are know to have completed works that remained unfinished when Giorgione died prematurely in his early thirties. (It was said that Giorgione contracted the plague from his mistress.) A second hand seems to be at work in this painting. The portrait's format, with subject glancing sidelong at the viewer from behind a parapet, was developed by Giorgione, and the soft, shadowy gradations of tone also recall his style. However, its aggressive mood points to a painter with a bolder brush and more active, worldly outlook, like Titian."
Zebra,Vasarely Victor,Op Art,animal painting,"Vasarely delivered one of the most important pieces of his career when he created [i]Zebra[/i], a painting inscribed in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/op-art]Op-art[/url] movement. The first version of this artwork had been made 30 years before the Op-art concept was conceived; however, it is considered to be a part of this movement. The last version of [i]Zebra[/i] was created in 1965.
 
Between 1939 and 1948, Vasarely laid out the fundamentals of Op-art in his early works. He was focused on studying the use of lines, the interaction between shadow and light, and the creation of perspective. Vasarely once affirmed: “The celebrated transition from the representational to nonrepresentational art is only one of the stages of profound transformation taking place in the plastics arts. The term ‘abstract’ in painting refers not to an established fact, but to an irresistible trend towards plastic creation different from the kind we already know.”
 
[i]Zebra[/i] can be apprehended as a study of shape, contrasts, and optical illusions. It seems like Vasarely picked the adequate animal for representing in one of the firsts pieces of the Op-art movement. In [i]Zebra[/i] from 1937, the animals pose in front of a white background, and the contrast is obvious. Even though the background color is different, the same effect occurs with the [i]Zebra[/i] from 1965. The stripes of the animal mesh with the background (especially in the 1965 piece) because the drawing doesn’t have borders. Also, curvilinear stripes of the zebras create an illusion of movement, playing with the awareness of the human eye."
A Friends' Reunion,Ernst Max,Surrealism,portrait,"Seated from left to right: Rene Crevel, Max Ernst, Dostoyevsky, Theodore Fraenkel, Jean Paulhan, Benjamin Peret, Johannes T. Baargeld, Robert Desnos. Standing: Philippe Soupault, Jean Arp, Max Morise, Raphael, Paul Eluard, Louis Aragon, Andre Breton, Giorgio de Chirico, Gala Eluard"
Ubu Imperator,Ernst Max,Dada,symbolic painting,"Like many of Ernst's paintings during his Paris period (1922-1941), Ubu Imperator resembles a collage in painted form. The artist's knowledge of Freudian theories, familiarity with myth and extreme wit are reflected in this early painting, which is now considered proto-Surrealist due to its strange juxtapositions."
"The Virgin Spanking the Christ Child before Three Witnesses: Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, and the Painter",Ernst Max,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"Here, portrayed as an earthy, frustrated woman, the Virgin Mary sharply paddles her young son - the unruly baby Jesus - on his bottom which displays red marks already left by her punishing hand. Watching through the background window and serving as witnesses are [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray/andr%C3%A9-breton-1930]Andre Breton[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/portrait-of-paul-eluard]Paul Eluard[/url], and the painter himself; all three seem untroubled by the scene. Ernst successfully upends both his own Catholic faith with its devotion to Christ's mother Mary, while simultaneously debasing much of Western art history with its proliferation of loving scenes between the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Christ child, and also, undercutting the secular, bourgeois sanctity of motherhood. Ernst's painting is simultaneously blasphemous and sharply humorous. As expected, not everyone saw humor in the theme and the work created considerable controversy as an attack on Christianity and contemporary values."
Forest and Dove,Ernst Max,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"Forest and Dove exemplifies Ernst's pioneering ""grattage"" technique - the painting equivalent of frottage - where he scraped paint across the canvas to reveal imprints of objects beneath. The small dove within the menacing forest that threatens to consume it is a familiar motif in Ernst's work, referring to his dispossession after the war."
Loplop Introduces Loplop,Ernst Max,Dada,symbolic painting,"The bird figure Loplop was Ernst's alter ego. This painting shows not only the artist's fascination with mythology and the primitive as subject matter (as exemplified by the bird), but also his formal interest in attaching different materials to the canvas. Both of these impulses would prove vital to the work of Jackson Pollock."
My Egypt,Demuth Charles,Precisionism,cityscape,"This enigmatic painting, one of seven in Demuth's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/all-works#!#filterName:Series_architecture-of-lancaster,resultType:masonry]final major series[/url], depicts a concrete and steel grain elevator in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The massive structure looms over the smaller, red buildings nearby - perhaps barns or family homes - almost shoving them out to the sides and corners of the canvas. Several intersecting beams of light illuminate the grain elevator like an actor on stage, reiterating its importance while adding a geometric fracturing reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] to the composition. 

The painting has been interpreted as both a critique of modernization and a celebration of it. The title suggests that industrialization is a pinnacle of American achievement equivalent to the great monuments of the ancient world, evoking the pyramids of Egypt and their symbolic association with life after death, which may have been a compelling idea to Demuth, who was bedridden by illness at numerous points throughout his life. At the same time, the painting may also allude to the slave labor that built the great monuments to the pharaohs. Thus serving as a critique of the dehumanizing effect of industry on American workers.

This work is one of Demuth’s most famous paintings and is understood to be a psychological self-portrait of the artist."
I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (William Carlos Williams),Demuth Charles,Precisionism,poster,"""I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold"" is one of a series of eight abstract portraits of friends, inspired by Gertrude Stein's word-portraits, that Demuth made between 1924 and 1929. This painting pays homage to a poem by William Carlos Williams. Like Marsden Hartley's ""Portrait of a German Officer"" and Arthur Dove's ""Ralph Dusenberry,"" this portrait consists not of a physical likeness of the artist's friend but of an accumulation of images associated with him — the poet's initials and the names ""Bill"" and ""Carlos"" that together form a portrait.

Williams' poem ""The Great Figure"" describes the experience of seeing a red fire engine with the number 5 painted on it racing through the city streets. While Demuth's painting is not an illustration of Williams's poem, we can certainly sense its ""rain/and lights"" and the ""gong clangs/siren howls/and wheels rumbling."" The bold 5 both rapidly recedes and races forward in space, and the round forms of the number, the lights, the street lamp, and the arcs at the lower left and upper right are played against the straight lines of the fire engine, the buildings, and the rays of light, infusing the picture with a rushing energy that perfectly expresses the spirit of the poem."
"Love, Love, Love (Gertrude Stein)",Demuth Charles,Precisionism,poster,"[i]Love, Love, Love[/i] is part of a group of so-called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/charles-demuth/all-works#!#filterName:Series_poster-portraits,resultType:masonry]poster portraits[/url] of various artists and writers painted by Charles Demuth between 1924 and 1928. They are all symbolic portraits in which the sitter’s identity is constructed from various words and objects. Demuth embraced a tradition of Modernist portraits established the previous decade by artists and writers such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/marsden-hartley]Marsden Hartley[/url], Marius de Zayas, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-picabia]Francis Picabia[/url] and Gertrude Stein herself. Instead of depicting the subject’s facial features, Demuth employs different kinds of emblems and signs, engaging in a kind of play with the viewer. By doing so he furthermore calls into question the notion of identity in portraiture, a complex and controversial theme. Creating an actual likeness was thus not an essential aim. 

In the present portrait of the American writer, he uses an enigmatic mask, the numbers 1, 2 and 3 and the word “LOVE” repeated three times, which stand out against the flat background that is divided into two by a marked diagonal separating black from red. Whereas the meaning of the mask is indecipherable, the figures may refer to the writer’s fondness for the number three."
Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla,Cassatt Mary,Realism,portrait,"After completing works for the archbishop of Pittsburgh in Parma, Italy, Cassatt, traveled to Spain, where she lived for a few months. She first copied the Spanish masters in Madrid, and worked in a studio in Seville. She made many paintings, such as Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla, which illustrated the beauty and style of the local Spanish women. This painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1874, in which it was entitled “Ida,” and attracted the attention of Edgar Degas. Cassatt and Degas would later have a fruitful career together, as fellow painters exhibiting at the Impressionist Salons."
Little Girl in a Blue Armchair,Cassatt Mary,Impressionism,portrait,"In this significant piece from her later career, Cassatt decided to depict a solitary young girl within the confines of a domestic setting. The Impressionist style is evident in the discernible brushwork and casual posture of the figure. The composition's asymmetry, elevated perspective, limited depth, and abrupt cropping of the scene indicate the influence of Japanese art. Cassatt's own insightful observations inform the construction of this image. The child, who was the offspring of one of Degas' acquaintances, is seated in an unconstrained manner that conveys her youthfulness. The way she is overwhelmed by the adult furnishings around her highlights the discomfort and isolation that sometimes accompany certain stages of childhood."
The Cup of Tea,Cassatt Mary,Impressionism,portrait,"Mary Cassatt’s sister Lydia was a big part of her life. Neither of them deciding to marry, they lived together in France until Lydia’s death in 1882. While she was alive, Mary used Lydia as a model in many of her paintings, The Cup of Tea being one of them. This painting is more of a genre painting than a portrait, as it represents a social custom that Cassatt revisited many times in her paintings: the taking of a cup of tea. Painted in an impressionistic manner, many art critics viewed the painting as unfinished, due to the fact that Cassatt left small peripheral portions of the canvas unpainted."
Nude Child,Cassatt Mary,Japonism,genre painting,"In her clear-headed treatment of mothers and infants, Cassatt was, for her time, entirely alone. ""The bunch of English and French daubers have put them in such stupid and pretentious poses!"" complained the critic J.-K. Huysmans, contrasting them with Cassatt's ""irreproachable pearls of Oriental sweetness."""
The Letter,Cassatt Mary,Japonism,genre painting,"In April of 1890, Cassatt visited an exhibition of Japanese colored woodcuts at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Afterward, she decided to produce a sequence of ten prints that would depict the daily life of a contemporary woman. The completed series contained depictions of women getting ready, washing their children, having tea, and more. This particular piece portrays a woman sealing a letter at her desk. The composition creates balance by combining patterns (the wallpaper and the woman's dress) with solid areas of color (the vertical back of the desk and the paper of the letter and envelope). The viewer is drawn into the shallow space of the room, where the skewed writing panel of the desk illustrates the use of forced perspective. These artistic choices were influenced by traditional Japanese printmaking, but the woman's clothing and other objects are all contemporary elements of Cassatt's world.

Mary Cassatt often depicted the private lives of women and children in her paintings. The Letter is one such painting, which she created in the Japanese wood block print style. The graphic decorations on the woman’s dress, as well as the wallpaper behind her, indicate the extent of Japanese art on her style. The artwork, which depicts a woman sitting at a desk inside, mailing an envelope, is a more than just a quaint genre painting. By painting the woman indoors, Cassatt was making a statement about the way women were treated. In this case, the woman is sitting inside in solitude, due to the fact that social mores restricted the activities that she could do outside the home."
The Child's Bath,Cassatt Mary,Japonism,genre painting,"Although she exhibited at the Impressionist Salon, Cassatt’s works encompassed many styles, and she frequently innovated new techniques for her paintings. In The Child’s Bath, we can see her influence from Japanese wood block prints. At the time she created this painting, the high vantage point, tight cropping of the forms, and bold outline were all unconventional artistic devices. Cassatt was able to avid an over-sentimental portrayal of this intimate scene by using the aforementioned techniques, diving us a glimpse into the bath without dripping with sweet sentimentality. Cassatt was also influenced to use this Japanese wood block technique by the works of Edgar Degas, who created many similar works."
The Bath,Cassatt Mary,Impressionism,genre painting,"In this carefully observed moment of a mother bathing her young daughter, Cassatt combines the stylistic influences of Japanese art with the subject matter from her own world. The composition's diverse patterns, including various floral designs and the woman's bold striped dress, are unified by a subdued palette of grays and mauves. The soft color scheme enables the viewer to focus on the central subject of the scene, which is the close bond between the mother and child. Their intimacy is evident from their proximity and the circle of touch that extends from the woman's hand on the child's foot to the child's hand on the woman's knee. They are as closely connected as the pitcher and bowl they use for this domestic ritual. With works like this one, Cassatt transforms the conventional artistic subject of the Madonna and Child from religious to secular imagery."
Young Mother Sewing,Cassatt Mary,Impressionism,genre painting,"Mary Cassatt’s most recurrent themes were women out and about in society or in the privacy of their own home with their children, or spending time alone. By the 1890’s, she had settled primarily on painting mothers and their children, or children alone. The themes of children and childhood reflected Cassatt’s deep affection for her family, including many nieces and nephews. Young Mother Sewing depicts a young mother, intently sewing, as her small child carelessly flops onto her lap. Undeterred, the mother continues to finish her work. The painting was set in the conservatory of Cassatt’s home in Le Mesnil-Theribus, Oise, France."
Horse in a landscape,Marc Franz ,Expressionism,animal painting,"'Horse In Landscape' (1910) is one of the earliest works where Franz Marc, inspired by Kandinsky, experiments with colors. In this painting, there's a purple horse with a blue mane and tail looking over a landscape defined by yellow, red, green and blue areas. The horse is standing with its back to the observer, so that it can take the viewer's perspective."
The Yellow Cow,Marc Franz ,Expressionism,animal painting,"[i]The Yellow Cow[/i] (1911) is one of the first examples that exhibit Marc's mature style. It stands in contrast with Marc's early style, and his previous depictions of animals, in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/deer-at-dusk-1909][i]Deer at Dusk[/i][/url] (1909) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/grazing-horses-1910][i]Grazing Horses[/i][/url] (1910). These paintings were naturalistic and reflected many hours spent painting outdoors. From the outset, Marc was drawn to nature, to the movement and behavior of animals. He was not unique here, as 'back to nature' movement swept Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Artistic collectives and nudist colonies emerged in agricultural areas in response to an overall dissatisfaction with an increasingly materialistic and secular society. Artists sought a more essential and spiritual existence in nature, and eventually, Marc left the city for the small Bavarian village, Sindelsdorf. As [i]Deer at Dusk[/i] and [i]Grazing Horses[/i] show, Marc sketched and observed cows and horses in the meadows of Bavaria and deer in the forest. For Marc, animals had certain godliness and spirituality that man no longer possessed. Animals were his primary subjects throughout his artistic evolution.

In [i]The Yellow Cow,[/i] the artist strived to convey his spiritual ideals, and his primary means of expression was color. Marc's interest in color can be traced to his admiration for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url], who developed a theory of color symbolism. From his correspondences, we know that Marc discussed Van Gogh's perception of color with fellow artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/august-macke]August Macke[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url]. Marc formed his color theory: he ascribed characteristics to each color and outlined complementary and harmonious color combinations. Blue related to masculinity, spirituality, and severity, and yellow represented femininity, qualities of joy, gentility, and sensuality. The third primary color, red, represented matter, it was brutal and heavy and opposed to the other two.

[i]The Yellow Cow[/i] embodies Marc's female principle by exuding joyfulness and abundance. In order to balance the yellow, Marc created a vibrant landscape with patches of red, blue and green. According to one interpretation, [i]The Yellow Cow[/i] is a private wedding portrait that Marc made in honor of his union with Maria Franck in 1911. The pair attempted to get the necessary permits to get married in Germany, but they were denied twice. In 1911, they traveled to England to get married, even though their marriage was not legally valid in Germany. Still, the couple resided together and considered themselves husband and wife. In the painting, the cow would represent Maria, and Marc's self-portrait would be veiled in the blue mountains in the background. Whether this interpretation is accurate or not, the painting has a jubilant and cheerful quality. This quality sets it apart from other paintings by Marc, which had a dark and ominous tone. For example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/fate-of-the-animals][i]Fate of the Animals[/i][/url] (1913) shows the animals as innocent victims caught in flames, fleeing, and struggling."
The Dream,Marc Franz ,Cubism,symbolic painting,"[i]The Dream[/i] demonstrates Franz Marc’s artistic evolution and the development of his symbolist color theory. Marc’s creative development was influenced by his meeting of German [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionist[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/august-macke]August Macke[/url] in 1910, and Russian artist and theorist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url] in 1911. Marc gifted [i]The Dream[/i] to Kandinsky shortly after its completion, and in return, Kandinsky gave Marc his painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky/improvisation-12-rider-1910][i]Improvisation 12 (Rider)[/i][/url] (1910).

Marc painted [i]The Dream[/i] in Sindelsdorf, a small village near the Bavarian Alps, which the artist moved to in 1909. Marc showed disdain for city life; he wished to reconnect with nature, which was significant to his artistic thinking. The idyllic scenery brought him closer to his new spiritual vision that expressed the harmony between man and nature. In the painting, the woman surrounded by animals symbolizes the balance between the human and the animal world. Marc merged dream and reality: the central female figure is nude and asleep, surrounded by manifestations of her dream. The black sky in the background indicates nighttime and the dream state of the female character. Marc’s color no longer mimicked the real world; instead, the artist applied his color theory where each color had a symbolic function; for example, blue represented masculinity, severity, and spirituality, while yellow represented femininity, cheerfulness, and sensuality.

There are several recognizable influences in [i]The Dream[/i]. It has similar elements to Marc’s painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/shepherds][i]Shepherds[/i][/url] (1912), which depicts a nude couple in nature. Even though the female figure in [i]Shepherds[/i] is positioned at a different angle, the pose is reminiscent of the one in [i]The Dream[/i]. Both paintings also feature blue horses, which is probably the most recognizable motif in Marc’s art. The blue horse could also be identified with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/der-blaue-reiter-the-blue-rider]The Blue Rider[/url], the Expressionist group of which Marc was a key member, along with Kandinsky and Macke. Marc was fascinated with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/milan-futurist-group]Italian futurist group[/url] and their signature ‘lines of force’ that described the motion of objects and injected dynamism into futuristic compositions.

Similarly, Marc’s lines radiate from the female figure and give the composition rhythm and structure. Another noteworthy influence is French [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin]Paul Gauguin[/url], mainly works from Gauguin’s Tahitian period, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/sacred-spring-1894][i]Sacred Spring[/i][/url] (1894) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/a-day-of-no-gods-1894][i]Day of the Gods[/i][/url] (1894). Much like Gauguin, who was enamored with Tahitian life and nature, Marc’s images aimed to show a more primal and essential state of being.

After Marc’s death in 1916, the painting was featured in commemorative exhibitions held in Munich and Wiesbaden. Years later, while Kandinsky taught at the famous experimental art school [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/bauhaus#!#resultType:masonry]Bauhaus[/url], he was visited by Katherine Sophie Drier, an art patron and co-founder of the art organization [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/soci-t-anonyme]Société Anonyme[/url]. [i]The Dream[/i] was selected to be part of the International Exhibition of Modern Art organized by Société Anonyme, which toured New York and other American cities. Today, it is part of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum collection in Madrid, Spain."
The Tower of Blue Horses,Marc Franz ,"Expressionism, Futurism",symbolic painting,"[i]The Tower of Blue Horses[/i] is equally known for its aesthetic and artistic significance, and for its fascinating history. The large canvas (200x130cm) is representative of the height of Marc’s artistic achievement. Marc’s preparatory work is visible in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/the-tower-of-blue-horses-sketch-1912][i]The Tower of Blue Horses[/i][/url] (1912). The artist sent this ink and gouache sketch on a postcard to the German Jewish poet Else Lasker-Schüler, who was one of the few women affiliated with the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionist[/url] movement.

The artist created a tight composition, in which all of the elements move upward. This vertical motion is mainly established through color. In essence, the bottom of the painting is a deeply saturated blue that gradually transitions to light yellow and orange tones in the rainbow on the top. Like in other artworks, Marc applied his theory of color symbolism to the painting. The blue symbolized the male principle, severe and spiritual, and the yellow marked the female principle, gentle, cheerful, and sensual. The blue and red in the bottom created a high intensity, which needed to be broken up with the softness of the yellow. Besides, orange and blue are complementary colors, and in Marc’s color theory, this combination was harmonious and celebratory. Like the title suggests, the composition can be interpreted as a cluster of horses. The four horses possibly signify the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which relate to the atmosphere and tension before World War I. At the same time, given Marc’s interest in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/futurism]Futurist[/url] art, this could be an interpretation of how Futurist painters, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giacomo-balla]Giacomo Balla[/url], represented a movement in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giacomo-balla/dynamism-of-a-dog-on-a-leash-1912][i]Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash[/i][/url] (1912). If so, the tower of horses would be a rhythmical repetition of the successive movement of a single horse.

In the fall of 1913, the painting was exhibited in the First German Autumn Salon in Berlin. The exhibition was modeled after the French Salon d’Automne (Autumn Salon) and was the largest and most significant exhibition held in Germany before World War I. After World War I, the painting was acquired for the contemporary section of the National Gallery in Berlin. In 1937, the German Nazi Party launched its campaign against modern art and began confiscating artworks that they considered ‘degenerate’ from museums and galleries. The painting was included in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/degenerate-art]Degenerate Art[/url] exhibition that opened in July 1937 in Munich. This decision caused considerable controversy since Marc was killed while serving Germany during World War I. After a protest by the association of German officers, the painting was removed from the Berlin opening. 

For a while, the artwork was owned by Herman Goering, the commander of the German Luftwaffe, and one of the most influential members of the Nazi Party. Goering used his position to select his favorite pieces from the confiscated and looted artworks for his private collection, which also contained two other works by Marc. Various accounts claimed that the painting was almost destroyed and then saved on multiple occasions; however, after 1945, it vanished without a trace. Throughout the years, there were several reported sightings and speculations regarding the painting’s whereabouts. Still, no official record of [i]The Tower of Blue Horses[/i] exists after 1945."
The Fate of the Animals,Marc Franz ,"Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism","animal painting, abstract","[i]Fate of the Animals[/i] is an apocalyptic vision that reflected the atmosphere before the outset of World War I.  On the back of the canvas, Marc placed an inscription: “[i]And All Being is Flaming Suffering[/i].” Like this inscription, the vision is a chaotic scene where the animals flee in terror from the flames. Through the use of diagonals, Marc constructed a very severe and organized composition, which provided balance and order to a scene of confusion and chaos. At the same time, the diagonals add to the tension and intensity of the painting by emphasizing the contrast between the tones of blue, red, and green.

Marc created the painting sometime before May 1913, and originally titled it [i]The Trees Show Their Rings, The Animals Their Veins[/i]. However, following the advice of friend and artist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-klee]Paul Klee[/url], he changed the name to [i]Fate of the Animals[/i]. After Marc’s death, the painting was part of a memorial exhibition at the [i]Sturm Gallery[/i] in Berlin. Subsequently, a fire broke out in the storage space of the gallery and damaged parts of the painting. Paul Klee worked on the restorations, and while he restored the linear structure of the painting, he did not try to replicate Marc’s color scheme. In the restored section on the right, the somber brownish tones lack the vitality and brightness of Marc’s original coloring. Following the restoration, the painting was purchased for the Moritzburg Museum in Halle. In 1936, it was confiscated by the Nazi Party, that labeled modern art as ‘[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/degenerate-art]degenerate art[/url]’. The painting resurfaced in 1939 when it was auctioned off with other confiscated works and bought by the Basel Kunstmuseum, where it still resides.

Marc’s vision of horror and destruction merged several sources of inspiration. Stylistically, Marc created a synthesis of elements from several art movements of the period: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cubism]cubistic[/url] structures, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/futurism]futuristic[/url] ‘lines of force,’ and color treatment inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/orphism]Orphism[/url], which was developed by painters [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-delaunay]Robert[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sonia-delaunay]Sonya Delaunay[/url]. The natural elements in the painting were probably inspired by ancient Nordic myths, which were popularized by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and composer Richard Wagner. For example, the central motif of the tree relates to [i]Yggdrasil[/i], a giant world-ash tree that nourishes all spiritual and physical life in ancient Nordic cosmology. As such, the tree might be providing shelter and protection to the group of animals hiding on the right. In terms of subject, Marc’s apocalyptic image is linked to a story by French novelist, Gustav Flaubert, [i]The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitalier[/i]. Marc admired Flaubert, and just before [i]Fate of the Animals[/i], he painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/saint-julian-l-hospitalier-1913][i]St. Julian the Hospitaler[/i][/url] (1913). In the story and Marc’s painting, Julian creates havoc and destruction, and his victims are animals. However, the destruction is necessary because it ultimately instigates Julian’s purification and redemption. Similarly, pre-war [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionists[/url], like Marc, believed that the corrupt and soulless society they lived in could only be reformed through radical change or destruction. This idea also manifests itself in [i]Fate of the Animals[/i]: it is an apocalyptic vision that can lead to man’s redemption."
Broken Forms,Marc Franz ,Cubism,abstract,"[i]Broken Forms[/i] was one of Marc’s last paintings created in 1914 before he left for the war. This year, he created some of his best-known animal paintings, as well as several abstract paintings, including [i]Broken Forms[/i]. The abstract paintings signified a stylistic and artistic development for Marc. It was a significant transition from works, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/blue-horse-i-1911][i]Blue Horse I[/i][/url] (1911) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/tiger-1912][i]Tiger[/i][/url] (1912), which preserved a strong connection to the natural world. Marc’s contemporaries, such as friend and fellow member of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/der-blaue-reiter-the-blue-rider]The Blue Rider[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url], already adopted an abstract style in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky/composition-iv-1911][i]Composition IV[/i][/url] (1911) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky/painting-with-green-center-1913][i]Painting with a green center[/i][/url] (1913).

Marc began to show signs of moving towards an [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/abstract-art]abstract style[/url] in an earlier painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/stables-1913][i]Stables[/i][/url] (1913). Here, Marc made significant steps toward abstraction while still keeping the animal subject matter. He created an interplay between the horse’s rumps, and the diamond and rectangular shapes. The round shapes at the bottom and the color scheme remind of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-delaunay]Robert Delaunay[/url]’s work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-delaunay/simultaneous-contrasts-sun-and-moon-1913][i]Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon[/i][/url] (1913, dated on painting 1912). Marc became familiar with Delaunay’s work in 1911 and visited his studio in Paris in October 1912. Another significant step in his gradual shift toward abstraction is the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/forms-at-play-playing-forms-1914][i]Forms in Play[/i][/url] (1914). The format of [i]Forms in Play[/i] is similar to [i]Stables[/i], and its structure consists of three parts. Like Kandinsky, who at times left traces of landscape in his paintings,  Marc left in [i]Forms in Play[/i] some shapes which suggest plants and wildlife. In comparison to [i]Forms in Play[/i], [i]Broken Forms[/i] is closer to pure abstraction as it has no connection to the physical world.

One of Marc’s goals was to create art that expressed the yearning for a whole existence that did not rely on sensory perception. He viewed sensory perception as deceptive and wished to show the spiritual life behind everything. It was the guiding principle for Marc’s aesthetic, which led him to develop his color symbolism and select animals as his primary subject matter. Marc found that animals possessed innocence and spirituality that humans no longer had, and therefore were the most suitable subjects for his art. By moving towards abstraction in [i]Broken Forms[/i], Marc probably realized that this style would bring him closer to his aim of showing the spirituality and essence of things. The origin of the title is unknown, but the wording is quite similar to the other titles of abstract paintings that Marc created in the same year, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/fighting-forms-1914][i]Fighting Forms[/i][/url] (1914), [i]Forms at Play[/i], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc/cheerful-forms-1914][i]Cheerful Forms[/i][/url] (1914) ([i]Cheerful Forms[/i] was destroyed during World War II). The idea of ‘brokenness’ comes most clearly in the black angular shape that dominates the center of the canvas. At the same time, Marc created a penetrating effect with vertical rays that break the solid colors of the forms. Today, the painting is part of the Guggenheim collection in New York."
Self-Portrait with Brushes,Hofmann Hans,Expressionism,self-portrait,"Hofmann created many self-portrait drawings and paintings, usually depicting himself at work. Self-Portrait with Brushes is typical of his approach, yet it stands out in the way it combines styles to create an expressive character sketch. Using bold outlines to exaggerate his own features - creating a broad triangular nose and tousled hair - Hofmann projects a playful persona in a blue on yellow palette set within the interior space of his studio."
The Wind,Hofmann Hans,Action painting,abstract,"Pictures such as The Wind have been at the center of a long controversy over whether Hofmann inspired Jackson Pollock's use of the drip technique. Some have claimed that Pollock saw pictures like this when he visited Hofmann's studio in 1942, and that this inspired his first use of poured paint in 1943.It was first thought that this work was produced in 1942, but now, professionals believe, that The Wind was produced around 1944, and that it was Pollock and Hofmann's twin interest in the work of Andre Masson, among others, that led both men to experiment with dripped paint at the same time."
Ecstasy,Hofmann Hans,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In 1947, Hofmann abandoned painting on board and began to use canvas. He also began to explore a wider variety of styles, and Ecstasy reflects his experiments, showing his continued loyalty to European masters such as Joan Miro and Hans Arp at a time when many of Hofmann's American colleagues were trying to overcome European influences."
The Gate,Hofmann Hans,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"The Gate was painted in 1959–60 as part of a series of works loosely devoted to architectonic volumes. Hofmann used rectangles of color to reinforce the shape of his essentially unvarying easel-painting format. Although The Gate is subjectless, Hofmann insisted that, even in abstraction, students should always work from nature in some form. With determination, a viewer can see that the complex spatial relationship established by the floating planes of color begins to resemble the gate of the title."
Love Poem,Hofmann Hans,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In 1948 Hans Hofmann wrote the essay The Search for the Real in the Visual Arts in which the lifelong teacher and theorist outlined his thoughts on the formal aspects of painting. Hofmann believed that a painting should remain true to its two-dimensional form, rather than containing three-dimensional perspective. Interest could be added to a painting through contrasting shapes, colors, and textures, which Hofmann termed “push and pull.” This is displayed in Poème d’amour through the contrasting use of dripped paint and rigid geometric forms."
Memoria in Aeternum,Hofmann Hans,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In Memoria in Aeturnum (Eternal memory) Hofmann remembers five American painters who died in their prime: Arthur B. Carles, an early American Cubist, and four other abstract painters—Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, and Bradley Walker Tomlin. Painted near the end of his life, Hofmann’s work is a tribute to the preceding decades of abstract art, incorporating a wide range of techniques that evoke the spirits of the departed: stains, drips, drawn-out brushstrokes, and smooth-edged geometric forms."
To Miz - Pax Vobiscum,Hofmann Hans,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"Hofmann's first wife, Miz, was a constant support and companion to him for almost 60 years, and after her death he painted this vibrant canvas as a memorial. He used the relationship of bright colors to create shapes expressing his feelings of loss."
Die Fahne Hoch!,Stella Frank,Minimalism,abstract,"The use of basic geometric systems in the work is regarded by many as the precursor of Minimalism. The painting was made by marking equal subdivisions along the sides, bottom and top edges of the canvas and using these intervals to generate simple, symmetrical patterns comprising bands of black enamel paint separated by thin lines of unpainted canvas.

Frank Stella gave the work a provocative title. Die Fahne Hoch! is named after the anthem of the Nazi Party, the Horst-Wessel-Lied, and is one of several paintings in the series that make direct reference to Nazism. By applying a hotly emotive title to the image, Stella's ironic purpose was that of destabilizing the idea of meaning itself."
The Marriage of Reason and Squalor,Stella Frank,Minimalism,abstract,"Belonging to the artist's groundbreaking series Black Paintings, The Marriage of Reason and Squalor is composed of black inverted parallel U-shapes containing stripes separated by thin lines of unpainted canvas. The repeated geometric pattern, in combination with the work's lack of figuration or expressive brushwork, prompts the viewer's recognition of it as a flat surface covered with paint, rather than a depiction of something else, upending the centuries-long concept of painting as window onto illusionistic three-dimensional space. The Black Paintings' stark simplicity, impersonal handling of the medium, and use of repeated geometric forms made them enormously influential on the emergence of Minimalism, whose practitioners likewise pursued the viewer's pure interaction with the art object. Along with three other of the Black Paintings, this work was included in the seminal MoMA exhibition Sixteen Americans. As if denying the painting's evocative title, Stella issued his famous maxim ""What you see is what you see,"" in relation to this painting."
Harran II,Stella Frank,Color Field Painting,abstract,"In his exploration of formal issues, Stella habitually worked in series, developing increasingly complicated variations on selected themes. In contrast to the monochrome Black Paintings, the Protractor series, to which Harran II belongs, deploys a vivid palette and composition consisting of rectangular shapes superimposed on curving and circular forms. As in The Marriage of Reason and Squalor, Harran II's stripes emphasize the flatness of the composition, reminding the viewer that a painting is merely canvas covered with paint. This concept is reinforced by the use of the shaped canvas, which, challenging the conventional rectangular format, further denies the painting's status as illusionistic window and enhances its ""object-like"" quality. Harran II - whose title comes from the name of an ancient city in Asia Minor - invites parallels with sculpture as well as architecture. Measuring a massive 10 x 20 feet, the work is architectural in scale, while its composition was based on the semicircular drafting tool for measuring and constructing angles."
Michapol I,Stella Frank,Hard Edge Painting,abstract,"The shaped canvas recurs in the works of Stella's Polish Village series, to which Michapol I belongs. Each composition is developed from color variations and interlocking geometric forms influenced in part by Russian Constructivism. Also inspired by Polish synagogues of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries, the works of the Polish Village series are large-scale collages, in which the artist pasted felt, paper, and wood onto the stretched canvas. Despite their sculptural qualities, Stella described the impulse behind Michapol I and the other works of the series as ""pictorial."""
Shoubeegi,Stella Frank,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"The present piece is part of Stella's Indian Bird series, in which the artist further expanded the category of ""painting."" Stella deployed painted curlicue aluminum forms that jut out into the viewer's space - increasing the works' object-like nature and diminishing their appearance as paintings hanging on a wall. Stella's use of assembled parts and three-dimensional elements notwithstanding, he still regarded the Indian Bird series - at the time his most sculptural work - as consisting of paintings or painted reliefs. Seen by some at the time as ""disco-like,"" the series' garishly colorful palette - produced by adhering particles of metal shaving or ground glass to a first layer of color, which were then painted or stained over - was also new to his oeuvre. Stella began the series during his 1977 stay in Ahmedabad, naming the individual works after birds found on the Indian subcontinent."
The Fountain,Stella Frank,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In the Fountain, Stella further explores the boundaries between artistic media. Although mural-sized, the piece - measuring 7 x 23 feet - is not a painting, but a print. The Fountain is Stella's most extensive work on paper to date and his culminating achievement in the medium of printmaking - a vital aspect of Stella's work since the 1960 - utilizing seven processes and sixty-one different colors. The piece belongs to a large, diverse series Stella created between 1985 and 1997 based on Herman Melville's Moby Dick. As such, for Stella it constitutes an homage of sorts to Abstract Expressionism, a number of whose artists also created works inspired by Ahab's epic struggle with the whale. Fittingly, and in keeping with the nonrepresentational nature of Stella's work, The Fountain is abstract, reflecting Stella's goal of conveying both a sense of motion and the power of the story, rather than the specific narrative."
"Prinz Friedrich von Homburg, Ein Schauspiel, 3X",Stella Frank,Abstract Expressionism,sculpture,"Given Stella's creation of numerous, at times large-scale, paintings with protruding three-dimensional elements, the production of freestanding sculptures or architectural structures might have seemed the next logical step for the artist. Prinz Friedrich von Homburg, Ein Schauspiel, 3X is just that - a massive composition whose spiraling forms and clusters continues the visual lexicon of the artist's painterly reliefs. Sitting outside the National Gallery of Art, it is one of Stella's first monumental works - weighing in just under ten tons and measuring an enormous 31 x 39 x 34 feet. The title comes from the name of a play by the eighteenth-century German playwright Heinrich von Kleist about love and war."
Butcher's Shop,Carracci Annibale,Baroque,genre painting,"The Butcher's Shop, a painting by Carracci, is categorized as a genre painting that offers a glimpse into the everyday life of Italians during the late 1500s. The artwork showcases butchers preparing meat for sale, with the central figure in the foreground preparing a lamb for slaughter. Meanwhile, his assistants are hooking up carcasses for display. In a humorous touch, a customer wearing an oversized feather hat in the left corner is shown fumbling for money to pay for his purchase. Carracci's uncle was a butcher, and some historians have suggested that family members may have been represented in the painting.

During the late-sixteenth century in Bologna, artisans and shopkeepers occupied the lower rungs of society and were vulnerable to economic instability and a weakened guild system. Carracci's painting reflects his commitment to ""painting from real life,"" with broken brushwork adding authenticity to the humble butchers depicted as masters of their trade. The inclusion of the humorous caricature of the paying customer adds a light-hearted touch to the artwork."
The Bean Eater,Carracci Annibale,Baroque,genre painting,"The Beaneater, a naturalistic genre painting by Carracci, depicts an everyday scene of Italian life. The artwork portrays a man eating a simple meal of beans, onions, bread, and wine. To convey a rustic feel, Carracci employed broken brushwork, deviating from the flat, polished finish preferred by fine artists during the late 16th century.

Carracci skillfully combined portraiture and still life in the composition, showcasing his ability to unite different elements in a single painting. This candid approach was unique during a time when monumental depictions of biblical figures and posed portraits of the wealthy dominated painting. The lack of composure and level perspective creates a similar effect to a photograph taken from across a table. The beaneater is captured in a spontaneous moment, with blushed cheeks and an open mouth indicating his direct engagement. Although the portrayal may seem unflattering, the level perspective places the viewer on the same social level as the subject, showcasing Carracci's sympathy for the simple daily routines of the working class. This humanistic strategy was innovative during the 16th century, where wealthy commissions dominated portraiture."
"Venus, Adonis, and Cupid",Carracci Annibale,Baroque,mythological painting,"The painting Venus, Adonis, and Cupid by Carracci portrays a story famously associated with the Roman poet Ovid. The artwork captures the moment before Cupid's arrow strikes Venus, causing her to fall in love with Adonis. Adonis is shown with hounds that will accompany him on a hunt with a wild boar, which ultimately leads to his demise. A pair of doves symbolizing love is depicted in the foreground, while an intricate landscape featuring ancient ruins and chaotic skies infuses the narrative with drama.

Carracci's painting showcases his diverse range of influences, drawing from Veronese, Titian, and Greco-Roman sculptures. Both Veronese and Titian also painted this fable, and similarities can be drawn between the compositional approach of all three artists. The interaction between Venus and Adonis takes place in front of a naturalistic landscape, displaying Carracci's skill as a naturalist painter. The sculptural formation of the figures' bodies, combined with the use of light to illuminate the smooth texture of their skin, creates a subtle realism that contrasts with the preferences of the Mannerists. Carracci's ability to play with light is further showcased in the cloth materials, particularly in the iridescent sheen of Adonis's robe."
"Copy of Battle of Anghiari, the lost painting by Leonardo da Vinci",Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,battle painting,"Copy after a fresco by Leonardo da Vinci in the Palazzo della Signoria in Florence, executed in 1504-1505 and destroyed around 1560. 
Rubens, who traveled to Italy between 1600 and 1608, did not see the sketch of the Battle, destroyed around 1560. However, he had access to Leonardo da Vinci's drawings and studied them. Rubens's work was based on an engraving of 1553 by Lorenzo Zacchia, which was taken from the painting itself or possibly derived from a cartoon by Leonardo. 
In March 2012, it was announced that a team led by Maurizio Seracini has found evidence that the Lost Leonardo still exists on a hidden inner wall behind a cavity, underneath a section of Vasari's fresco in the chamber of Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. 
Its central scene depicted four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at The Battle of Anghiari in 1440. Purportedly, from left to right are Francesco Piccinino; Niccolò Piccinino; Ludovico Trevisan; Giovanni Antonio Del Balzo Orsini."
Samson and Delilah,Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,religious painting,"In this painting, Ruben depicts the moment when a servant cuts Samson’s hair, the source of his great power, while he is sleeping, after which he is arrested by Philistine soldiers, who can be seen through the doorway in the background of the painting. The painting was commissioned by the alderman of Antwerp, Nicholas Rockox, for his town house. Upon his death, the painting became part of the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna, along with Rubens’ other masterpiece The Massacre of the Innocents. It was incorrectly attributed to Gerard von Honthorst, a Flemish painter, contemporary of Rubens’ who, like Rubens, also was heavily influenced by Caravaggio’s works."
The Elevation of the Cross,Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,sketch and study,"The Elevation of the Cross is a triptych panel painting, depicting many rippling-muscled men lifting Jesus in the Cross. This painting clearly shows the influence of Michelangelo, Caravaggio, and Tintoretto, all of whose paintings influenced Rubens a great deal. Rubens completed the painting after returning to Flanders from Italy, after the death of his mother in 1608. This painting, along with The Descent of the Cross, was taken from Belgium by Napoleon, but they were later returned at the end of the 19th century. They are both now located in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp."
Descent from the Cross - triptych,Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,religious painting,"The Descent from the Cross is a triptych panel painting, depicting many men lowering Jesus from the Cross. This painting clearly shows the influence of Michelangelo, Caravaggio, and Tintoretto, all of whose paintings influenced Rubens a great deal. Rubens completed the painting after returning to Flanders from Italy, after the death of his mother in 1608. This painting, along with The Elevation of the Cross, was taken from Belgium by Napoleon, but they were later returned at the end of the 19th century. They are both now located in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp."
Wolf and Fox Hunt,Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,"genre painting, wildlife painting","With characteristic business acumen, Rubens created a market for a new art form: very large hunting scenes painted on canvas, of which this one is the first. The few earlier examples were either models for or copies after tapestries, but Rubens’s large ""hunts"" of about 1616–21 were made as replacements for that very expensive medium. This canvas, originally more symmetrical in design, was trimmed at the top and left side because (according to a client in 1616) ""none but great Princes have houses fitt to hange it up in."" Rubens painted the picture with the help of assistants but declared that the wolves were his own work."
The Judgment of Paris,Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,mythological painting,"Rubens completed a number of works of the same title, the most notable of which are the ones he completed in 1636 and 1638. They illustrate his ideal form of a full-figured female body. The 1938 version is considered to be the last work created by Rubens, as at this time he was ill with gout, which led to his death in 1640. As a model for the women figures, he used his young bride, who in 1630 married the then-16 year old girl, and who often served as his idealized version of the female body. The painting was commissioned by the brother of the Spanish King, Philip IV. After his brother’s death, the king declared the painting immodest, and ordered it to be burned. Fortunately, he died before the painting could be ignited, and it now hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain."
Massacre of the Innocents,Rubens Peter Paul,Baroque,religious painting,"This is the first in a series of two paintings by Rubens of the same name. This particular piece was held in the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna Austria, since the 17th century. In 1767, it was miscatalogued as a piece by one of Rubens’ students, which remained an error until 2001, when an expert art historian correctly attributed the work to Rubens, based on his similar work Samson and Delilah. It then sold at auction the next year for £49.5 million, and was later donated to The Art Gallery of Ontario, inn Toronto Canada."
"Portrait of a Gentleman (supposedly Juan Mateos, Philip IV’s Master of the Hunt)",Velazquez Diego,Baroque,portrait,"In August 2010 a number of works by the nineteenth century British artist, Matthew Shepperson, were consigned for sale at Bonhams Auction House. Among these works was a portrait of a gentleman, which was brought to the attention of experts who advised to withdraw it from sale for further investigation. The stylistic similarities to works by the great Spanish master led to extensive research, further technical analysis and an x-radiograph confirm the attribution to Velázquez. Researchers think he painted the portrait between 1632 and 1635, after his first trip to Italy. The sitter is unknown, but experts think it could be Juan Mateos, master of the hunt for Philip IV of Spain. Until the nineteenth century, little was known outside of Spain of Velázquez's work. His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the French marshals during the Peninsular War. It remains a mystery how Matthew Shepperson, a jobbing artist who made minor ducats copying famous paintings at Buckingham Palace, got his hands on a Velázquez. He made a hobby of collecting portraits, and the painting is in excellent condition so he probably had no idea it was even as old as it is. An invoice of seven shillings was found in his papers that could refer to his purchase of the unknown Velázquez portrait. And so the painting that was bought for several shillings, and was due to go for sale for £300 is now expected to fetch up to £3 million, 10,000 times exceeding the original estimate. By the last count there were ninety-eight acknowledged pictures solely by Velazquez in existence and only four are in private hands."

Other interpretations of the saying state that the inscription on the tomb simply reads “I was an Arcadian.” Either way, this painting, in a more Baroque style reminiscent of his earlier works, remains one of Poussin’s most influential paintings. It has also inspired a documentary about the painting entitled In Arcadia, surrounding the Poussin painting."

Three fellow soldiers observe in the background; the tallest may be a self-portrait of André Derain who painted this work during a year of military service. The artist takes a humorous approach to his subject, presenting the dance as an awkward social ritual. This early picture is notable for its areas of bold, flat color, anticipating Derain’s experiments with Fauvism."
The Bridge at Le Pecq,Derain Andre,"Fauvism, Neo-Impressionism",cityscape,"André Derain’s painting [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i] (1904-1905) is one of the early examples of the artist’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvist style[/url]. Derain along with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Henri Matisse[/url] was one of the leaders of the fauvist movement, an artistic movement that developed at the beginning of the 20th century and flourished between 1904 and 1908. The group of artists, Derain, Matisse and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maurice-de-vlaminck#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Maurice de Vlaminck[/url] launched the Fauvist movement at the 1905 exhibition at the [i]Salon des Indépendants[/i] (The Salon of Independent Artists). The same year art critic Louis Vauxcelle used the term ‘[i]Fauve[/i]’ (‘wild beasts’ in French) to describe this new style of painting. The nickname ‘Fauve’ expressed a mixed impression, appreciating the vibrancy and unrestrained energy of their paintings but also expressing shock and apprehension. [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i] was one of Derain’s paintings exhibited at the 1905 [i]Salon des Indépendants[/i] exhibition.

In the fall of 1904, Derain was at his home in Chatou, a small town on the river Seine located northwest of Paris. During this time, he explored the area looking for new subjects to paint. [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i] depicts a bustling scene on the bank of the Seine at Le Pecq, an area where goods were transferred from workboats to horse-drawn carts. [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i] demonstrates Derain’s early advancements in landscape painting and his ability to combine different manners of painting. The background was executed in a Neo-Impressionist style, which was characterized by the use of a divisionist technique. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/divisionism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Divisionism[/url] artists applied primary colors separately on the canvas in tiny dabs that would mix in the viewer’s eye. The flecked brushstrokes over the broad color zones resembled the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Van Gogh[/url]. [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i] probably prompted the art critic Vauxcelles to comment on how Derain’s combination of elements from Van Gogh’s art and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/japonism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]japonisme[/url] (a French term that refers to the fascination with Japanese art) were ‘ingeniously decorative’. In the painting, Derain used a vibrant and unexpected palette to depict a cold winter day. This can be attributed to the influence of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Paul Gauguin[/url], who used color to express the emotional and spiritual qualities of things.

[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/les-fauves#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]The Fauve artists[/url] encouraged and influenced each other styles. For instance, the elongated figures in [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i] were probably connected to the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/albert-marquet#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Albert Marquet[/url], a painter associated with the Fauvist movement. Additionally, Derain’s relationship with Matisse likely pushed him to introduce Neo-Impressionist elements to his painting. Derain spent the spring of 1905 with Matisse at the village of Collioure in the south of France. The village became the meeting place for Fauvist artists, where they painted some of their greatest masterpieces. The landscapes painted at Collioure, such as the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/view-of-collioure-1905][i]View of Collioure[/i][/url] (1905) represented Derain’s departure from the mixed-techniques that characterized [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i]. The brushstrokes in the [i]View of Collioure[/i] no longer merged like those in [i]The Bridge at Le Pecq[/i]. Instead, Derain moved to a new phase, in which he fully embraced Divisionism."
Landscape,Derain Andre,,landscape,"""André Derain (French, 1880–1954), Landscape. Oil on canvas, about 1906. 21 in. by 31 ¾ in. Purchased with funds from the Libbey Endowment, Gift of Edward Drummond Libbey, 1951.379. Gallery 3
“I am aware that the realist period in painting is over. We are about to embark on a new phase… I believe that lines and colors are intimately related and enjoy a parallel existence from the very start, and allow us to embark on a great independent and unbounded existence.” — André Derain, 1905

André Derain here transforms the traditional subject of the landscape with thick black outlines, strong brushstrokes, and bold layers of color. The inspiration of nature remains important, but the work is just as much a world of the artist’s own creation as Derain takes liberties of creativity and self-expression.

Studying engineering in Paris as a young man, Derain befriended painters Georges Rouault and Henri Matisse and began to pursue his own artistic desires. A 1901 Van Gogh exhibition was hugely influential and Derain and his peers, spurring interest in expressive color and abstracted form. Reviewing an exhibition of Derain, Matisse, and other artists in 1905, a critic pronounced them fauves, or wild beasts, for the boldness of their color and line (the artists’ brash style became known as Fauvism).""

Waterloo Bridge,Derain Andre,"Divisionism, Neo-Impressionism",cityscape,"[i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] (1906) belongs to a group of works Derain painted in London, which he visited on three occasions between March 1906 and February 1907. The London paintings were commissioned by Parisian art dealer, Ambroise Vollard, who took an interest in Derain’s work and even purchased the artist’s entire output in November 1905. At the beginning of the 20th century, Derain and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Henri Matisse[/url] were the leaders of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvism[/url], a groundbreaking artistic movement, which built on the legacy of previous generations of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Impressionist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Post-Impressionist[/url] artists. Even though [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/les-fauves#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvist artists[/url] explored similar themes to those of the Impressionists, they were innovative in their approach to color – in their paintings, color was not only a mean of capturing the light and atmosphere, it was a mean for expressing emotions.

Derain was captivated by London, painting a variety of subjects: historical sites like the Palace of Westminster, city’s parks and bustling streets. However, like his predecessors, the Romantic painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]J.M.W Turner[/url] and the Impressionist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claude-monet#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Claude Monet[/url], Derain chose to focus on the river, painting many scenes of the banks of the Thames. Matisse encouraged Derain to visit London’s museums and in particularly to see Turner’s paintings. Shortly before his arrival to London, Turner’s unfinished paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner/the-thames-above-waterloo-bridge-1835][i]The Thames above Waterloo Bridge[/i][/url] (ca. 1830-1835) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner/norham-castle-sunrise-1845][i]Norham Castle, Sunrise[/i][/url] (ca. 1845) were exhibited for the first time at the [i]Tate Gallery[/i]. In terms of color, it indeed seems that Derain’s London scenes were closer to Turner’s Venetian paintings than Monet’s views of London.

[i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] depicts the view of the Waterloo Bridge from the Victoria Embankment. It features a blurry view of the Houses of Parliament on the right, and the industrial buildings of the Baltic Wharf on the left side of the painting. However, the focus of the painting is the bright blue bridge that serves as the horizontal line of the composition. [i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] embodies the Fauve spirit – Derain used pure colors from the tube to create a bright and colorful vision of London. The application of pure colors on the white canvas relates to the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-signac#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Paul Signac[/url] and Signac’s approach to color in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-signac/young-women-of-provence-at-the-well-1892][i]Women at the Well[/i][/url] (1892). Derain painted [i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] in a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]pointillist technique[/url] that he began employing in the summer of 1905, when he was staying with Matisse in Collioure. The dabs of bright greens, blues and purples give the surface the appearance of a mosaic. In comparison to the Collioure painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/mountains-at-collioure-1905][i]Mountains at Collioure[/i][/url] (1905), the shades of yellow and blue in [i]Waterloo Bridge[/i] are cooler, keeping with the London ambience. While shades of blue, green and purple dominate the canvas, Derain creates a burst of the bright yellow and pink sunlight that erupts from the top right corner of the painting. The bright light reflects on the water in the lighter dabs of yellow and green. For Fauvists colors had an expressive function, and Derain described them as “[i]cartridges of dynamite whose purpose is to discharge light[/i]”. Waterloo Bridge is part of the collection of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid."
The Dance,Derain Andre,Fauvism,genre painting,"[i]The Dance[/i] (1906) by André Derain reflected his eclectic style and interest in a variety of Western and non-Western artistic traditions. He painted [i]The Dance[/i] in the autumn of 1906, after he returned from London to Paris, and after he visited the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin]Paul Gauguin[/url] retrospective at the annual Paris exhibition [i]Salon d’Automne[/i] (Autumn Salon).

Although Derain combined several influences in [i]The Dance[/i], Gauguin’s influence is the most dominant. Most evidently, the exotic elements and landscape in [i]The Dance[/i] relate to Gauguin’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_2nd-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry]Tahitian paintings[/url] that celebrated the lush, tropical environment. For example, the seated figure in the background is similar to those painted by Gauguin. Derain even borrows some elements from Gauguin’s symbolism, such as the long serpent intertwined between the dancing figures. The serpent with its religious and symbolic implications was a motif in Gauguin’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/self-portrait-with-halo-1889][i]Self Portrait with Halo and Snake[/i][/url] (1889) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/exotic-eve-1890][i]Exotic Eve[/i][/url] (1890-1894). However most importantly, Derain’s use of color no longer reflected the ideas of Neo-Impressionists. Instead, in [i]The Dance[/i] Derain built upon [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Style_synthetism,resultType:masonry]Gauguin’s Synthetic style[/url], which aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist’s emotional response to the subject and the aesthetic considerations of line, form and color. Inspired by Gauguin, Derain painted large areas of bold flat colors and used non-local colors not to merely imitate nature, but also to express the emotional and spiritual qualities of things.

The emphasis on the decorative elements in [i]The Dance[/i] can be attributed to Gauguin, but these also relate to another source – French Romanesque sculpture. Derain’s treatment of the drapery worn by the dancer on the left is most similar to the sculptures from the Burgundy area, in the cathedrals in Autun, Saulieu and Vezelay. Even though there is no evidence that Derain visited Burgundy, examples were available to Derain in photographs and in museum collections – specifically, Derain visited the National Museum of French Monuments that holds life size casts of the cathedrals in Burgundy. Derain also found inspiration in the Louvre, likely modeling the figure on the right after the servant figure in Eugène Delacroix’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix/the-women-of-algiers-in-their-apartment-1834-1][i]Women of Algiers[/i][/url] (1834).

The other major influence is non-Western art, a combination of sources of African and Asian art. In [i]The Dance[/i] these elements reflect Derain’s interest in Gauguin and the influence of non-Western art on his work, as well as his own affinity for these artistic traditions. Derain had access to many of these artworks through the Guimet Museum in Paris, which holds one of the largest collections of Asian art outside of Asia. [i]The Dance[/i] is similar to Indonesian relief sculpture in terms of composition and the motif of dancing figures against a flat stylized landscape. In particular, the three central figures resemble a 10th century pediment from the Cambodian temple Banteay Srei at the Guimet Museum. In the context Derain’s body of work, [i]The Dance[/i] concluded the artist’s decorative [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauve style[/url], after which he painted in a more sculptural style inspired by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Cézanne[/url] and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubist movement[/url]."
London Bridge,Derain Andre,Fauvism,cityscape,"In 1905, French painter André Derain was commissioned by his art dealer Ambroise Vollard to paint views of London. Derain set up his easel outdoors and went to work. The subject of this landscape, London Bridge, was one of several bridges built across the River Thames as part of a larger movement at the turn of the 19th century to modernize the city center with grand new architectural projects and public works. London Bridge is one of about 30 paintings Derain produced over his two-month stay, all depicting activity on or around the Thames.

It’s not surprising that Derain’s art dealer was interested in views of London. Nineteenth-century London saw a huge growth in population (from 1 million in 1800 to over 6 million a century later) as mechanical industry, especially the building of railways, took hold. Derain saw the changes and created a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city. The artist later recalled: “Fauvism was our ordeal by fire. . . It was the era of photography. This may have influenced us and played a part in our reaction against anything resembling a snapshot of life. No matter how far we moved away from things, it was never far enough. Colors became charges of dynamite.”"
Bathers,Derain Andre,Fauvism,nude painting (nu),"André Derain’s painting [i]Bathers[/i] (1907) marks the final phase of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]Fauvism[/url], which was characterized by the dominant influence of the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url]. This brief period called ‘Cézannism’ represents a phase in which the final stages of Fauvism overlapped with early [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url]. Derain’s painting [i]Bathers[/i] was exhibited at the 1907 [i]Salon des Indépendants[/i] (The Salon of Independent Artists). The painting still had the vivid and intense colors of Fauvism, but Derain modeled the angular forms after Cézanne. Even though Cézannism took shape in 1907, Cézanne was a topic of discussion among [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/les-fauves#!#resultType:masonry]Fauvist artists[/url] long before. Derain was well acquainted with Cézanne work: there were forty-two Cézanne paintings at the 1904 [i]Salon d’Automne[/i] (Autumn Salon) exhibition, ten at 1905 exhibition and ten at the 1906 exhibition. His friend and fellow Fauvist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse#!#resultType:masonry]Henri Matisse[/url] purchased Cézanne’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/three-bathers][i]Three Bathers[/i][/url] (1879-1882) in 1899. Additionally, a 1910 photograph of Derain shows that the artist kept a reproduction of Cézanne’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/five-bathers-1887][i]Five Bathers[/i][/url] (1885-1887) in his studio.

Thus, although Derain’s [i]Bathers[/i] were built upon the themes of his earlier paintings, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/the-dance-1906][i]The Dance[/i][/url] (1906) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/golden-age][i]The Golden Age[/i][/url] (1905), the subject was also a reference to Cézanne’s Bather series. Unlike earlier works, that focused on flat colorful surfaces, in [i]Bathers[/i] the principal concern was with angular planes and sculptural forms. Derain mixed several influences in [i]Bathers[/i]: while the figures bear some similarity to Cézanne’s fleshy nudes, the other dominant influence is African art and culture. In 1905, Derain and painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maurice-de-vlaminck#!#resultType:masonry]Maurice Vlaminck[/url] began visiting the Musée du Trocadéro, which had a collection of tribal art and African masks. Around the same time, Derain began collecting African art, a collection he built up between the years 1906 and 1910. The influence of African sculpture is seen in the angular faces of the bathers. More specifically, the central figure was possibly modeled after a mask that Derain purchased from Vlaminck. A different possibility is that he modeled the central head after the block-like forms of French Congo sculptures. The pose of the bather on the left side was similar to Derain’s stone sculpture [i]Standing Figure[/i] (1907), which was also inspired by African sculpture.

[i]Bathers[/i] shows Derain’s innovative thinking: he completed the painting before the 1907 Cézanne retrospectives and before [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso#!#resultType:masonry]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s famous [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-girls-of-avignon-1907][i]Les Demoiselles d'Avignon[/i][/url] (1907). Scholars have debated the connection between Derain’s [i]Bathers[/i] and Picasso [i]Les Demoiselles d'Avignon[/i], some arguing that Picasso influenced Derain’s transition from Fauvism to Cézannism. Others claimed the opposite, that in fact Picasso was indebted to Derain, who made some of the early strides toward Cubism. However, what is most likely is that Picasso and Derain worked independently during the same period with Cézanne as their chief inspiration. Moreover, in this period artists like Matisse, Derain, Picasso, Vlaminck and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque#!#resultType:masonry]Georges Braque[/url] were all experimenting and discovering African art. Therefore, the similar interests of Cubists and Fauvists can account for Derain and Picasso reaching similar breakthroughs around the same time."
Harlequin and Pierrot,Derain Andre,Neoclassicism,genre painting,"This famous painting at the Musée de l'Orangerie was an order André Derain received from Paul Guillaume. Derain chose to depict two characters from the Italian theatre known as the Commedia dell’Arte: Harlequin in his colourful chequered costume and bicorn hat, and Pierrot in his white frock with ruff, head covered by a black calotte. Amongst the painters, Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), Auguste Renoir (1841-1919) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) had already taken an interest in this theme of saltimbanques that had been popular since the 16th century.
Nonetheless, Derain created an original work: Harlequin and Pierrot, with one knee raised and both playing the guitar, appear against a neutral background in a never-ending dance like marionettes or puppets. Their gazes do not meet and they have serious expressions on their faces. Therefore the painting is suffused with a certain melancholy quality. Derain prepared for this work by making several preliminary drawings. He also paid close attention to the small still life in the bottom right of the painting that anchors the composition. The figure of Pierrot was finally recognised as a portrait of Paul Guillaume.
This painting appeared several times during the lifetime of its sponsor. It can be seen in a photograph of his flat on Avenue de Messine. Derain alluded to this painting in the background of a portrait of Domenica Guillaume that he painted between 1928-1929 and that is conserved at the Musée de l'Orangerie.

The Painter and his Family,Derain Andre,Neoclassicism,genre painting,"[i]The painter and his family[/i] (ca. 1939) by André Derain is more than a self-portrait or family portrait, it is a manifesto of Derain’s beliefs and views on painting. Much like the 19th century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet/the-artist-s-studio-1855][i]The Artist’s Studio[/i][/url] (1854-1855) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gustave-courbet]Gustave Courbet[/url], the painting is an allegorical representation of the life of an artist. While Courbet presented himself among admirers and members of the public, Derain surrounded himself with female family members and pets. The scene did not reflect his working conditions, Derain usually worked in a studio away from his family. The emphasis on the intimate and domestic realm possibly expressed his desire to withdraw from the public and the worsening political situation of the inter-war period. In this period, Derain especially identified with 17th century painters like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Diego Velasquez[/url]. It is possible that The painter and his family was inspired by Velasquez’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/las-meninas-detail-of-the-lower-half-depicting-the-family-of-philip-iv-of-spain-1656][i]Las Meninas[/i][/url] (1656), in which the artist is seen at the studio painting the young girls of the Spanish royal court.

The painting depicts Derain working at his easel, while his wife Alice reads a book of myths. This is a reference to their common interest in legends and myths. Derain also painted a peacock, a reference to chivalric literature and a cat that symbolized his fascination with arcane and mystical practices. The painting relates to an earlier work by Derain, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-derain/the-artist-in-his-studio-1920][i]The Artist in his Studio[/i][/url] (1920), that also shows the artist painting at his easel. [i]The Artist in his Studio[/i] depicts a similar domestic environment: his wife Alice is reading in the background while a small boy holds a bowl of fruit in the foreground. The two paintings have a similar dark palette, mainly black with highlights of green, red and white. However, the scene in [i]The painter and his family[/i] is richer in detail and occupied by more figures. Suzanne Géry, Alice’s sister, is seen in the background holding a tray, while her daughter Geneviève is behind the artist holding a small pooch. 

Suzanne and Geneviève were an intimate part of Derain’s family circle: from 1928 the two lived in the Derain’s home, and later in 1935 they moved to La Roseraie at Chambourcy, where they lived across the courtyard from Derain and his wife. Derain treated Geneviève as his own daughter, and painted her many times. In [i]The painter and his family[/i] her face is luminous, and her position behind the artist places her in the role of a guiding light or a muse. In addition, the dog is a medieval symbol of fidelity: his presence can signify Geneviève’s loyalty to the artist or maybe Derain’s loyalty and devotion to art. The symbolism and atmosphere of [i]The painter and his family[/i] corresponds with Derain’s understanding of painting. Derain believed that art should ‘equalize time’, meaning that regardless of its superficial form, art should deal with universal truths that define the human experience. In both [i]The Artist in his Studio[/i] and [i]The painter and his family[/i] Derain proclaimed that the nature of art to be private and intimate, and therefore he depicted himself working in a domestic setting."
Garden at Vaucresson,Vuillard Edouard ,Post-Impressionism,landscape,"This painting was begun in 1920 at Vaucresson, a residential suburb west of Paris, where Vuillard’s friends Lucy and Josse (Jos) Hessel had recently purchased the house depicted in the background. Jos, a partner in the art firm of Bernheim-Jeune, had become Vuillard's dealer in 1912. His wife was one of Vuillard's great loves; their relationship spanned more than three decades, until the artist's death in 1940. The woman in a housedress standing at right is Lucy's cousin Marcelle Aron. Lucy kneels across from her, at left, camouflaged by one of the large rosebushes that serve as a decorative screen in the foreground.

The Education of the Children of Clovis,Alma-Tadema Lawrence ,Romanticism,genre painting,"Painted in 1861, The Education of the Children of Clovis was Alma-Tadema’s first major work. It created a sensation when it was first exhibited at the Artistic Congress in Antwerp of the same year, and it cemented his growing reputation. According to Alma-Tadema, his teacher Jan August Henrik Leys was accepting of the work, but critical of the marble, which he likened to the texture of cheese. Taking the criticism very seriously, Alma-Tadema spent years perfecting his technique of variegated marble and granite. He became so well known for his realistic marble that he was eventually humorously referred to as a “marbelous painter.”"
In the Tepidarium,Alma-Tadema Lawrence ,Romanticism,nude painting (nu),"The Tepidarium depicts a warm Roman bath, of the same name. The woman on the sofa holds a large strategically placed ostrich feather and a strigil, which was used for scraping the skin after soaping and oiling it. The A and F Pears Soap Company originally bought the painting, intending to use it in a soap advertisement, but never did, for the fear that its erotic nude might shock customers. It was later sold to a private collector in 1916. This painting exemplifies Alma-Tadema’s ability to render exact architectural details with soft and luxurious textures, providing a glimpse of romantic reality."

The Women of Amphissa,Alma-Tadema Lawrence ,Romanticism,genre painting,"Alma-Tadema met his second wife, Laura, when she was only seventeen years old, and apparently fell in love with her at first sight. Although he used the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War as a pretence to move to England, it is thought that he actually moved to London to be closer to Laura. Upon his arrival, he contracted with Laura for private art lessons, and thereafter asked her to marry him. Although her father originally refused due to their age difference (she was 18, he was 34), he relented on the condition that the two got to know each other first. Apparently the match was good, as they stayed married for the rest of their lives. Alma-Tadema used his wife, Laura Therese Alma-Tadema, who was a painter in her own right, as a model in many of his paintings, The Women of Amphissa of which is the most prominent example."
The Roses of Heliogabalus,Alma-Tadema Lawrence ,Romanticism,genre painting,"The Roses of Heliogabalus is one of Alma-Tadema’s most famous paintings. It depicts the Roman Emperor Egabalus (Heliogabalus), a debauched psychotic. In this episode, he is attempting to smother his unsuspecting audience with rose petals, which have been let loose from false ceiling panels. Alma-Tadema, being a meticulous perfectionist, wanted each petal to be as perfectly realistic as possible, and had shipments of rose petals sent to him from the Riviera over the winter of 1887-1888, so he would have fresh examples. This was a common practice by Alma-Tadema, who often ordered flowers from all over Europe and sometimes Africa, as examples for his paintings, rushing to complete the work before the flowers died."
Spring,Alma-Tadema Lawrence ,Romanticism,genre painting,"In this painting, Alma-Tadema depicted the practice of sending children out to get flowers on the morning of May Day, or May 1st, but placed the scene in ancient Rome. A great historical researcher, Alma-Tadema was meticulous about portraying the historical elements in his paintings as the actually appeared. In this painting, he went to great lengths to portray the Roman originals, everything from the music instruments to the architectural details and dress are accurate to Roman history.  He had an insatiable curiosity about classical antiquity, and he created over three hundred paintings on the topic. This painting was used a reference for Cecil B. De Mille’s movie “Cleopatra,” in 1934."

In the Style of Kairouan,Klee Paul,Expressionism,abstract,"After Klee’s visit to Tunisia, where he was inspired by the quality of light, he returned home with the determination to be a painter, which was something he previously was unable to call himself. This led him to create this painting, a composition of simple colored shapes, and was the first purely abstract painting created by Paul Klee. This composition is an illustration of Klee’s ability to use intonations of color to evoke a musical feeling. He begins the composition with the large rectangle in the center, then builds upon it’s strength and color to build the remainder of the composition, which flows from the first large note."
Death for the Idea,Klee Paul,Expressionism,symbolic painting,"At the beginning of World War I, Klee felt distanced from the event and it affected him very little. However, after his two friends Marc and Macke both died in the conflict, the effects of the war began to take hold on his consciousness. He used art as an outlet for his distress, creating a series of lithographs of war scenes. In Death for the Idea, we see a body lying at the bottom of a series of lines and shapes, building up above him like a cityscape. Klee joined the war effort, but was spared battle, as he was employed instead as a clerk, as well as to paint camouflage on airplanes. He was also able to paint throughout the war and his work was included in many exhibits."
Persian Nightingales,Klee Paul,Cubism,abstract,"""Literary references permeate the works of Swiss artist Paul Klee, whose Persische Nachtigallen (Persian Nightingales) most likely alludes to the verses of the fourteenth- century poet Hafiz.

Mortal never won to view thee, Yet a thousand lovers woo thee; Not a nightingale but knows In the rose-bud sleeps the rose.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe introduced the Persian writer to Germanspeaking audiences in his West-östlicher Divan, and it was probably here that Klee first learned of Hafiz's work. In sensuous poetic images, the Persian master celebrates the joys of love, wine, and the natural world. Two of his recurring motifs are the nightingale and the rose, the former symbolizing earthly yearning, and the latter divine beauty and glory.

A pink rose appears in the lower left quadrant of Klee's watercolor, cradled by two sharply pointed leaves whose forms mirror the nightingales' heads. Above and to the left of the flower is the letter R (presumably for Rose ). Three nightingales occupy center stage, and one of them is inverted and drunk with desire, its beak pointing toward the letter N (presumably for Nachtigallen). Celestial bodies float across the sheet, enlivening it with circles, halfmoons, and stars, while on the N's right stem Klee hoists a bright red pennant.

Klee further alludes to Persian miniature painting in the drawing's gemlike delicacy, ornamentation, and lustrous color, as well as its disregard for scale and perspective. Even the structure of the composition, which one seems to enter through an arched niche or parted curtains, recalls the format of many Persian miniatures. While Klee was living in Germany, from 1898 to 1933, he would have had ample opportunity to see Persian art in public collections, such as the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum in Berlin (now Bode Museum), as well as the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum and the Staatsbibliothek in Munich. He no doubt also saw an important 1910 exhibition of Islamic art in Munich that featured more than 3,500 objects, including, as Klee's friend and colleagueWassily Kandinsky wrote in a published review, ""carpets, majolica, weapons, ceramics, textiles, and finallyâ\u0080\u0094the most arresting and closest to us todayâ\u0080\u0094Persian miniatures.""

This radiant watercolor reflects in miniature a wondrous, microcosmic universe, one that even grants status to lowly consonants. Indeed, the letters R and N are fully integrated within the composition; they are scaled to the size of the nightingales and juxtaposed in the same indeterminate space. As is often the case in Persian art and particularly in Hafiz's poetry, the earthly and the divine are poised in a delicate and ambiguous balance. Individual shapes shift one against the other, each within the confines of Klee's wiry line and each flooded with thin washes of color. Although perfectly balanced for the moment, one senses that a tiny slip of a line in one direction or another might set the whole creation tumbling."""
Kamel in rhythmischer Baumlandschaft klein,Klee Paul,"Expressionism, Cubo-Expressionism",landscape,"Camel (in Rhythmic Landscape with Trees) (German: Kamel (in rhythmischer baumlandschaft)) is a painting by Swiss artist Paul Klee, made in 1920, in the collection of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Düsseldorf, Germany.[1]

The painting is one of the first Klee did in oils and is typical of the artist's interest in colour theory, draughtsmanship and musicality. It is also one of many images in Western art to use camels as subject matter.[2]

Temple Gardens,Klee Paul,"Cubism, Expressionism",figurative,"""Temple Gardens"" appears to recall Klee's impressions from his visit to Tunisia with Macke in April 1914. The watercolor has the brilliance of a stained-glass window on a sunny day. Stairways lead to the doors of various garden pavilions, palm trees peek over sections of high walls, and domed towers are here and there. Klee sometimes liked to rearrange his compositions with scissors. Perhaps in this instance, he thought the work looked too symmetrical and therefore cut it into three sections and moved the center one to the left. Now the site depicted in ""Temple Gardens,"" which earlier was only pleasantly full of the ""angles and corners"" he had admired in Kairouan, has become truly labyrinthine."
Twittering Machine,Klee Paul,Expressionism,figurative,"Twittering Machine (Die Zwitscher-Maschine) is a 1922 watercolor and pen and ink oil transfer on paper by Swiss-German painter Paul Klee. Like other artworks by Klee, it blends biology and machinery, depicting a loosely sketched group of birds on a wire or branch connected to a hand-crank. Interpretations of the work vary widely: it has been perceived as a nightmarish lure for the viewer or a depiction of the helplessness of the artist, but also as a triumph of nature over mechanical pursuits. It has been seen as a visual representation of the mechanics of sound. Originally displayed in Germany, the image was declared ""degenerate art"" by Adolf Hitler in 1933 and sold by the Nazi party to an art dealer in 1939, whence it made its way to New York. One of the better known of more than 9,000 works produced by Klee, it is among the more famous images of the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It has inspired several musical compositions and, according to a 1987 magazine profile in New York Magazine, has been a popular piece to hang in children's bedrooms.

The picture depicts a group of birds, largely line drawings; all save the first are shackled on a wire (or, according to The Washington Post, a ""sine-wave branch"") over a blue and purple background which the MoMA equates with the ""misty cool blue of night giv[ing] way to the pink flow of dawn"". Each of the birds is open-beaked, with a jagged or rounded shape emerging from its mouth, widely interpreted as its protruding tongue. The end of the perch dips into a crank.

Twittering Machine has invited very different opinions on its meaning, which Gardner's Art Through the Ages (2009) suggests is characteristic of Klee's work: ""Perhaps no other artist of the 20th century matched Klee's subtlety as he deftly created a world of ambiguity and understatement that draws each viewer into finding a unique interpretation of the work."" The image has frequently been perceived as whimsical, with a 1941 article in The Hartford Courant describing it as ""characterized by the exquisite absurdity of Lewis Carroll's ""Twas brillig and the slithy toves"" and The Riverside Dictionary of Biography placing it in ""a very personal world of free fancy"". Sometimes, the image is perceived as quite dark. MoMA suggests that, while evocative of an ""abbreviated pastoral"", the painting inspires ""an uneasy sensation of looming menace"" as the birds themselves ""appear closer to deformations of nature"". They speculate that the ""twittering machine"" may in fact be a music box that produces a ""fiendish cacophony"" as it ""lure[s] victims to the pit over which the machine hovers"". Kay Larson of New York magazine (1987), too, found menace in the image, which she describes as ""a fierce parable of the artist's life among the philistines"": ""Like Charles Chaplin caught in the gears of Modern Times, they [the birds] whir helplessly, their heads flopping in exhaustion and pathos. One bird's tongue flies up out of its beak, an exclamation point punctuating its grim fate—to chirp under compulsion."" Without drawing conclusions on emotional impact, Werckmeister, in 1989's The Making of Paul Klee's Career, sees a deliberate blending of birds and machine, suggesting the piece is part of Klee's general interest in ""the formal equation between animal and machine, between organism and mechanism"" (similar to the ambiguity between bird and airplane in a number of works). According to Wheye and Kennedy (2008), the painting is often interpreted as ""a contemptuous satire of laboratory science"".

Arthur Danto, who does not see the birds as deformed mechanical creatures but instead as separate living elements, speculates in Encounters & Reflections (1997) that ""Klee is making some kind of point about the futility of machines, almost humanizing machines into things from which nothing great is to be hoped or feared, and the futility in this case is underscored by the silly project of bringing forth by mechanical means what nature in any case provides in abundance."" Danto believes that perhaps this machine has been abandoned, the birds opportunistically using it as a perch from which they issue the sounds the inert machine is failing to produce.[9] Danto also suggests, conversely, that the painting may mean simply that ""it might not be a bad thing if we bent our gifts to the artificial generation of bird songs.""

Wheye and Kennedy suggest that the picture may represent a sound spectrograph, with the heads of the birds perhaps representing musical notes and the size, shape and direction of their tongues suggesting the ""volume, intensity, degree of trilling, and degree of shrillness of their voices"". This reflects the earlier view of Soby's Contemporary Painters (1948) that: ”The bird with an exclamation point in its mouth represents the twitter's full volume; the one with an arrow in its beak symbolizes an accompanying shrillness – a horizontal thrust of piercing song. Since a characteristic of chirping birds is that their racket resumes as soon as it seems to be ending, the bird in the center droops with lolling tongue, while another begins to falter in song; both birds will come up again full blast as soon as the machine's crank is turned.”

The Swiss-born Klee had been teaching at the Bauhaus school in Germany for a year when he completed this ink drawing on watercolor in 1922. The work was displayed for several years in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin until Adolf Hitler declared it and many other works by the Swiss-born Klee ""degenerate art"" in 1933. The Nazis seized the painting and sold it in 1939 for $120 to an art dealer in Berlin. The New York MoMA purchased the painting that same year.["
Ad Parnassum,Klee Paul,Expressionism,cityscape,"This painting, considered Klee’s masterpiece, is an example of Klee’s masterful skill with color. Small blocks of shifting colors float through the background, set in place with a thick black outline, evincing the idea of a building or a house. It is also the finest example of Klee’s ability in pointillism and technical ability as an artist. As an artist with great skill with color, he was also a great teacher at color mixing and theory. He wrote his great treatise, a collection of lectures, entitled Writings on Form and Design Theory, which is considered one of the most influential writings in modern art."
Struck from the List,Klee Paul,Expressionism,symbolic painting,"Klee was employed in many successful teaching positions throughout his life, but his stay at the Düsseldorf Academy in Nazi Germany was cut short. In 1933 he was singled out by a Nazi newspaper, which called him out as a Galician Jew. The Gestapo searched his house, and he was quickly fired from his job. Klee created Struck from the List to commemorate this terrible occasion. His sadness at being “stuck from the list” is evident in his monochromatic color scheme, depicting an image that is not entirely abstract, as it clearly resembles a sad faces, tears running down the cheeks."
Historic ground,Klee Paul,Expressionism,cityscape,"In 1910, Klee had his first solo exhibition, and the year later, became acquainted with Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, two avant garde figures in the art world. A further visit to Paris in 1912 exposed him to examples of Cubism and Abstract Art, or “pure painting,” which led him to experiment on his own with abstract shapes and color palettes. His landscape work Houses near the Gravel Pit, is one of the first of such experiments, which used blocks of color that did not overlap. This painting also illustrates his attempt to begin abstracting the visual forms into shapes and colors that led to idea of the design, rather than painting the design itself."
Angel Applicant,Klee Paul,Expressionism,religious painting,"It seems doubtful that this [i]Angel Applicant[/i], resembling the offspring of a bulldog and a Halloween mask, will ever reach heaven. In 1939, Klee composed twenty-nine works that feature angels, having in earlier years only sporadically depicted them. His angels were not the celestial kind but hybrid creatures beset with human foibles and whims. Klee's angels are ""forgetful, ""still female, ""ugly,"" incomplete,"" or ""poor""—as the titles he gave these pictures indicate.

Suffering from an incurable illness and sensing himself hovering between life and death, Klee possibly felt a kinship with these outsiders. In this work, he covered a sheet of newspaper with black gouache on which he then drew the outlines of the figure and of the crescent moon with a thick, soft graphite pencil. Then he filled in these forms with a thin white wash. It is the black ground peeking through the white pigment that gives this creature its ghostly shimmer."
Sea Grasses and Blue Sea,Avery Milton,Expressionism,marina,"Avery painted scenes of nature throughout his career, but he preferred simple forms to realistic details, and his palette is distinctively personal. The results come close to abstraction. In Sea Grasses and Blue Sea (based on Avery's memories of Provincetown, Massachusetts), the sky is a straight and narrow blue band at the painting's upper rim. The rest of the canvas is divided into two trapezoids of almost equal size and shape. The lower of these, the sea grass, is pale and lightly streaked, and echoes the tonality of the sky; above it is a wedge of a predominantly darker, saturated blue, with patches both of a lighter blue and, more sharply, of deep black. Magically, the overall effect is of waves flecked with white foam.
That black is paradoxical: as Matisse remarked of the black in one of his own paintings, it is used as ""a color of light and not as a color of darkness."" In various ways, in fact, Avery is closer to Henri Matisse than to the styles that prevailed in America during his lifetime-in his love of clarified form and flat color, for example, and in the sense of rich serenity that permeates his art."
Thérèse dreaming,Balthus,Expressionism,genre painting,"Balthus’s model, Thérèse Blanchard, appears—as the title of this work suggests—unaware of her surroundings and lost in thought. Blanchard was about twelve or thirteen when the artist painted this canvas. She would figure in at least nine other compositions, either alone or with her cat or her brother. Balthus, like countless modern artists, believed the subject of the child to be a source of raw spirit, not yet molded by societal expectations. Many early twentieth‑century avant‑garde artists, from Paul Gauguin to Edvard Munch to Pablo Picasso, also viewed adolescent sexuality as a potent site of psychological vulnerability as well as lack of inhibition, and they projected these subjective interpretations into their work. While it may be unsettling to our eyes today, Thérèse Dreaming draws on this history. [url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489977]MET[/url]"
Charred Journal: Firewritten V,Louis Morris,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"Charred Journal is executed in the traditional Abstract Expressionist style, and draws from the all-over style of Pollock's action painting. At only about two feet wide, the painting is dwarfed by some of Louis' Unfurleds, which measure over twenty feet horizontally. However, Louis manages to achieve a remarkable sense of dynamism within a relatively compact space. This canvas predates Louis' exposure to Helen Frankenthaler's stain paintings, after which he began his Veil series and mature Color Field work."
Russet,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Louis made Russet by pouring thinned acrylic paintdown a tilted unprimed canvas, allowing gravity, rather than a paintbrush, to dictate its flow and contours. The two dark vertical lines in the painting indicate where he folded the loose canvas to guide the paint in sections. Along the top of the canvas, the vibrant individual colors he used reveal themselves in the edges of this otherwise muted, ethereal painting. The work belongs to a series of breakthrough paintings the artist made between 1954 and 1958, known as Veils because of the translucent layers and billowing shapes of their aqueous pools of color. The title of this work refers to the overall reddish-brown tone of the paint and, like many of Louis's titles, was assigned to the work by Clement Greenberg, an influential American art critic and a close friend of the artist."
Dalet Kaf,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Dalet Kaf is an example of Louis' later Veils. Like the Unfurleds, they are poured from top to bottom, aided by gravity: to work within the small confines of his studio, Louis would staple canvas to the walls and pour paint from above. Here, the thin washes of paint slither across the surface of the canvas, the brighter colors muted by the ""veil"" of black that frames the composition."
Dalet Zayin,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Dalet Zayin is one of a group of paintings known as 'Veils' which Louis began in 1954, when experimenting with the technique of staining unprimed canvas, and then continued between 1957 and 1960. The later 'Veils', of which there are approximately 130, were begun in the winter of 1957-58, soon after his exhibition at the Jackson Gallery in November 1957.* The series was effectively concluded after his show at French and Company, held in April 1959, but occasional 'Veil' paintings were still painted until the winter of 1959-60. The exact dating of Louis' 'Veil' paintings within this sequence is problematic as most were not dated by the artist and remained unstretched and unexhibited for some time after his death.

Louis expressed little interest in the titles of his works at least from 1954 onwards. The paintings were only given titles when it became necessary, for example when a work left the studio for an exhibition.** Most paintings were therefore named posthumously. After Louis' death it was decided to title the 'Veils' with transliterations of names of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The pictures were titled arbitrarily, in order of being stretched. The title Dalet Zayin combines the fourth and seventh letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

Michael Lloyd & Michael Desmond European and American Paintings and Sculptures 1870-1970 in the Australian National Gallery 1992 p.300.

*Diane Upright Headley has dated the beginning of the second 'Veil' series at this date on the basis of a letter from Louis to Greenberg which mentions that a 'Veil' painting had been shown to a potential client in the spring of 1958. As this painting, Untitled 1958 (collection Mrs H. Gates Lloyd, Haverford, Pennsylvania), is a fully developed work it is likely that it was preceded by earlier trials (see Diana Upright Headley, 'In Addition to the Veils', Art in America, vol.66, no.1, January-February 1978, pp.84-94, cf. p.88)
**Even in the case of those works titled for exhibition, most of the titles it seems were suggested by the critic Clement Greenberg (see Diana Upright Headley, 'Morris Loius: The complete Paintings, New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1935, p.37) The generic title for Louis' series 'Veil', was coined by William Rubin (see William Rubin, letter to the editor, Artforum, vol. 9, no. 7, March 1971, p.78)."
Beth Zayin,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"The premise to Morris Louis' resplendent veil Beth Zayin was born out of his fastidious methodology that explored methods of paint application in an effort to preserve the picture-plane as a two-dimensional surface. Louis achieved this through an adaptation of a paint staining technique first revealed to him upon a visit to Helen Frankenthaler's studio in 1952 with Kenneth Noland. His resultant Veils would address formalist concerns of the canvas surface as an expansive, flat, nonfigural field. The Veils also share in the underlying principles contingent to Jackson Pollock's drip painting, as neither owed recourse to lines, edges, or contours denoting tangible things. (Michael Fried in Exh. Cat., Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, Morris Louis, 1912-1962, 1967, p. 11). In 1954, Louis's Veil paintings would immediately engage him with one of the most significant artistic circles of the time under the critical direction of Clement Greenberg. Greenberg professed the primacy of maintaining the integrity of formal principles in the basic elements of painting. With his color-stain technique, Louis's focus on the inherent nature of paint, canvas and color was in sympathy to Greenberg's teachings, and the critic included the spectral Veils in Louis's first solo exhibition at French & Company in New York.

Beth Zayin is abstinent of idiomatic brush application and is void of texture and gesture. Louis achieved this through the successive application of waves of synthetic acrylic resin paint, magna, which ebbed and flowed across the unprimed duck canvas. The final effects were suggestive of translucent color veils. The achievement of the technique would be hailed by art circles in the following years, ""Sometimes a direct manipulation of a given material without the use of any tool is made. In these cases considerations of gravity become as important as those of space;"" (Robert Morris, ""Anti-Form,"" Artforum 6, no. 8, April 1968, p. 35).

The monumental scale of the Veils, coupled with the vibrant saturation of pigment on the the surface of Beth Zayin, endows the present painting with a prowess that emulates the name it bears. Similar to the majority of the Veils, Beth Zayin was titled posthumously by the artist's estate. Zayin, the seventh letter of the Hebrew alphabet, literally means ""weapon"" or ""sword"", but derives from a root that means sustenance or nourishment. This verbal paradox appears to animate the painting's surface, as the bands of brilliant, curving color-shapes simultaneously submerge and emerge from the more somber, darker veils. While in some of the more melancholic Veils, the darker tones predominate, the spectrum of vivid color in Beth Zayin is ascendant, emerging from the edges of the darker veils and overpowering the composition with its primal force. Beth Zayin's expansive splendor and specific methodology exemplifies the triumph that is color-field painting."
Nexus II,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"'Nexus' means connection or link. The painting, made in 1959, marks the transition between two series of important paintings by Morris Louis, who created a new style of Abstract Expressionism in the last five years of his short life. The style was later called Post-painterly Abstraction by the critic Clement Greenberg. In Nexus II, plain fields of colour are pushed to the sides. Thin washes of denim blue on the left and jade green on the right are separated by an off-white panel. The effect of harmonious, even blissful, colour is intensified by the simplicity of means the artist uses, and the large size of the work."
Where,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"An iconic work in Morris Louis' oeuvre, ""Where"" represents the culmination of a ""theme"" that started with the ""Veil"" series. The stripes of pure, flat color (like a reconfigured rainbow) were in his earlier paintings hidden by a ""veil"" of paint, most often black and at times semi-transparent, being revealed only at the top edge of the painting. In slightly later paintings, such as ""Floral V"", the ""veil"" beings to be eliminated, only to be completely suppressed in ""Where"". The artist's intentions and methods of pouring the magna paint on canvas are not entirely known (not even his wife has seen him painting, as he used to paint before her wife returned from work). However, as art critic Clement Greenberg has suggested, Morris Louis, rejecting the dense surfaces and chaotic compositions of ""action painting"" as well as the dark tones of Rothko and Clyfford Still, preferred ""openness"" and ""clarity"". In general, Color Field painters' performance was to make color the very subject of their paintings. However, while certain painters such as Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly favored hard edges and systemic compositions, Morris Louis, even in his last ""column"" and ""stripe"" paintings (which used unmixed color, a tactic that further decreased the involvement of the painter's hand), couldn't be considered completely impersonal, thanks to the playful ends of some ""pillars"" and, in general, the vibrant colors the artist has chosen. Greenberg once written about Louis: ""He began to feel, think and conceive almost exclusively in terms of open color."""
Point of Tranquility,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Point of Tranquility is an example of Louis' Floral Veils, the last series he completed before embarking on the Unfurleds. Louis created the Florals by turning the canvas as he poured the paint, as opposed to working from a single vantage point. Louis layers the acrylic in a pattern that suggests a flower, the bleeding pigment creating a muddled, washy surface at the center of the canvas. The ""veils"" are apparent in the overlap of pigment, where washes both obscure and reveal layers of thinned color."
Delta Theta,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Delta Theta is a classic work from the Unfurled series, which are the most recognizable of Louis' oeuvre. Louis folded the massive canvas(almost 20 feet wide) before pouring the thinned acrylic, which soaks into the weave of the fabric in rainbows of color. Louis' work challenged the notion of ""completion,"" as he tended to leave large areas of the canvas untreated. Incorporating raw canvas into the final composition was a signature of the Color Field painters."
Partition,Louis Morris,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Partition is one of Louis' so-called Stripe series, all executed in the last months of his life. The vertical stripes evoke Barnett Newman's zip paintings, and, like Newman's work, these canvases are highly systematic and devoid of the painter's own expressive gesture. In these final works, Louis took the simplification of color and form to its extreme end, though he still exhibits interest in optical effects of color relationships and the fusing of paint and ground through his incorporation of the raw canvas into the composition."
Four Self-Portraits 05.3.81,Hamilton Richard,Pop Art,self-portrait,"‘Four Self-Portraits 05.3.81’ takes portraiture as its starting point, using new media to expand its boundaries. Instead of limiting the portrait to a single image, Hamilton uses four. In the early 1980s, the artist took Polaroids of himself and added layers of acrylic colour. After ten years, he digitally converted the photos into transparencies to be made into enlarged prints. Mounted on canvas, they epitomize the layered way in which Hamilton’s works deal with artistic media."
Suicide at Dawn,Brauner Victor,Surrealism,allegorical painting,"Suicide at Dawn presents a double figure literally, and fatally, divided against itself. The image floats against a black void, with bands of mottled gray above and below. Light falls on the left side of the pale figure. But highlights on the red figure suggest a light source to the right. The picture has no consistent perspective, no up or down, no sense of depth.

The Romanian artist Victor Brauner painted Suicide at Dawn in 1930, after fleeing to Paris to escape the rise of fascism in his home country. It may represent the artist’s conflicted self, or the struggle between life and death. It also recalls Romanian folk tales in which a hermit communes with his evil spirit double.

In Paris, Brauner met André Breton and other painters in the Surrealist movement, whose work he knew already. Works like Suicide at Dawn show that he had already achieved the Surrealists’ goal: to give visual expression to the inner reality of dreams, fantasy, and the unconscious."
Consciousness of Shock,Brauner Victor,Surrealism,symbolic painting,"A symbolic struggle is expressed between the human and bird halves of the hybrid form in Consciousness of Shock, in which Victor Brauner portrays a complex boat-shaped figure in the course of battling for control of itself. Drawn in the schematic profile style of Egyptian hieroglyphs, a large androgynous head unites with the raised prow of a boat elaborated with breasts. The body of the vessel, directed by rudderlike legs and feet, merges at the stern with the upright body of a bird. Two powerful hands, at the ends of crossed arms, suppress the internal battle by restraining the limbs of the bird, while a third hand doggedly forges progress along the river by paddling. Thus, in keeping with the nature of much psychic conflict, a difficult internal struggle is self-contained, while the vessel-self continues along a predetermined route.

Nicolas Calas has suggested that Brauner was inspired by two Egyptian themes, the “Sun Barge” and the “Heavenly Vault,” in the creation of this image. While a generalized Egyptian style undoubtedly influenced Brauner’s imagery, it seems more likely that the artist derived this fantastic visual vocabulary from his own imagination, rather from specific art-historical sources. (Elizabeth C. Childs)"
The Doll,Bellmer Hans,Surrealism,sculpture,"In the early 1930s, Bellmer created an almost life-sized figure of a young girl, which André Breton and Paul Eluard described as ‘the first and only Surrealist object with a universal, provocative power’. He recreated the doll in a variety of forms. This version makes the element of sexual fantasy explicit by reducing her to two sets of hips. It also derives from Bellmer’s desire to maximise the articulation of this substitute body/object through the use of ball joints. Indeed, this work was originally known as Ball Joint, and was exhibited in the 1936 Surrealist exhibition of objects held in Paris."
The Doll,Bellmer Hans,Surrealism,photo,"The Doll is a hand-coloured black-and-white photograph of a partially dismembered life-size doll sculpture. Partly influenced by Jacques Offenbach’s (1819-1880) final opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero falls in love with a realistic life-size mechanical doll, Hans Bellmer built his first Doll in 1933-4 and a second in 1935, of which this is a photograph.

Bellmer’s first Doll was an articulated construction of wood, plaster, metal rods, nuts and bolts which represented a young girl. A disquieting sculpture, it embodied a number of qualities of the surrealist object: subversive and erotic, sadistic and fetishistic. A German artist bitterly opposed to the Nazi regime, Bellmer moved to Paris in the late 1930s where he was embraced by the surrealist group and was described in the 1938 Dictionnaire abrégé du surréalisme as a ‘surrealist writer, painter, and builder of large dolls.’ (Quoted in Webb and Short 1985, p.53.)

The artist took a number of photographs of The Doll in various poses and stages of construction, ten of which were published with an accompanying text as Die Puppe in 1934. Eighteen of them were also published in the Surrealist review Minotaure in the same year (no.6, winter 1934). Soon the photographs of the Doll became as important as the sculpture itself: with their narrative function, they opened up new voyeuristic and fetishistic possibilities.

Bellmer completed a second doll sculpture in the autumn of 1935 and photographed it in different stages of dismemberment in over a hundred different scenarios, often shown wearing little white socks and the black patent leather shoes of young girls. The present photograph shows a version of the second Doll with no arms or legs, hanging from a tree. Her torso is actually a second pelvis placed back to front and upside-down on top of the central ball joint, which forms her stomach. The photograph is taken from below in a way that emphasises the doll’s breasts and genitals, while her face is partially obscured. Bellmer presents us with the aftermath of torture or abuse. Delicately hand-coloured in pale hues of yellow and green, the photograph, however, has a theatrical presence, as if to remind the viewer that it is a representation, rather than an act, of sadism.

With his Doll sculptures and photographs Bellmer appropriated and subverted the idea of the child’s toy. An erotic obsession, the Dolls incarnated his fascination for the corruption of innocence and for the writing of De Sade, whom he much admired. Yet, the art historian Hal Foster has written that there was also a masochistic subtext in the Doll photographs: ‘in his sadistic scenes Bellmer leaves behind masochistic traces; in his erotic manipulation of the dolls he explores a sadistic impulse that is also self-destructive. In this way the dolls may go inside sadistic mastery to the point where the subject confronts its greatest fear: its own fragmentation and disintegration.’ (Foster 2001, p.208.) The art historian Rosalind Krauss has also described Bellmer’s use of the Doll imagery as a tactic: ‘To produce the image of what one fears, in order to protect oneself from what one fears – this is the strategic achievement of anxiety, which arms the subject, in advance, against the onslaught of trauma, the blow that takes one by surprise.’ (Krauss 1997, p.196.)"
The Machine-Gunneress in a State of Grace,Bellmer Hans,Surrealism,sculpture,"Bellmer began creating disturbing dolls in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany. Many have interpreted them as acts of political defiance against the Aryan ideals and social norms promoted by the Nazis, whom he openly opposed, and expressions of the personal outrage he felt towards his father, who had joined the Nazi party. Bellmer himself stated, ""If the origin of my work is scandalous, it is because for me, the world is a scandal."" Made in Berlin one year before the artist left for Paris, where he lived for the better part of the rest of his life, this figure is violently fragmented, its body parts splayed and truncated and its scale distorted. Connected mechanically by ball joints, its appendages offer endless perverse recombinations, made all the more unsettling by suggesting the physical traits of both a mature woman and a prepubescent girl."
The Doll (Second Series),Bellmer Hans,Surrealism,photo,"Bellmer made his first doll in 1933 (see the note on T01157) and took a series of photographs of it in various states of dismemberment and rearrangement, and 'with the necessary background of vice and enchantment', which was first published as a book Die Puppein Karlsruhe in 1934, with a foreword by himself. The photographs were taken by Bellmer, while the settings were constructed by his brother.

His second series of photographs was based on the elements of the central sphere, sometimes with a head and sometimes with two pairs of legs, and was completed in December 1937. Some of the photographs were taken out of doors in the garden of his father's house. Bellmer took the photographs with him when he settled in Paris in 1938 and preparations were made for their publication. The foreword, which was originally written in German, was translated into French in 1938 with the help of Georges Hugnet, while the idea of hand-colouring the photographs (which had not been done in the case of the first series) was suggested by Paul Eluard. Eluard also wrote fourteen short prose poems in the winter of 1938-9 to accompany the photographs. However in the end the book was not published until after the war, in 1949, when it was brought out by Heinz Berggruen, in a very limited edition, as Les Jeux de la Poupée."
Portrait of Pablo Picasso,Gris Juan,Analytical Cubism,portrait,"[i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] (1912) by Juan Gris is considered one of the finest portraits of the cubist art movement. The portrait depicts [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, who founded [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] together with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Georges Braque[/url]. Picasso was a defining figure in Gris’s artistic development, and the painting honors him as a mentor. In 1906, Gris moved to Paris and settled in the Montmartre neighborhood. Soon after, he met Picasso, who introduced him to the leading painters, poets, and critics of the new generation like Braque, Guillaume Apollinaire, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/max-jacob]Max Jacob[/url], Maurice Raynal, and Pierre Reverdy. In his first years in Paris, Gris worked as a graphic artist, drawing illustrations for various political and satirical magazines. Influenced by his environment, he began to paint seriously in 1910, and the following year he decided to fully devote his time to painting. In a relatively short period of time, Gris began producing works comparable in quality to those of his older and more experienced colleagues.

Gris decided to make his artistic debut with [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] at the 1912 Salon of Independent Artists. Gris depicts Picasso as a painter, holding a palette in his hand. The inscription at the bottom right of the painting, “Hommage à Pablo Picasso” exhibits Gris’s respect for Picasso as a leader and innovator. The portrait draws from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/analytical-cubism]Analytical Cubism[/url], the early phase of Cubism that lasted from 1908 to 1912. The term Analytical Cubism describes the analytical approach to the subject matter: the artist deconstructs the subject by depicting it simultaneously from multiple points of view. In the portrait, Gris deconstructed the figure by fracturing the head, neck, and torso into various planes and geometric shapes. Gris created a very organized composition with a regulated structure of diagonals. The painting has limited to a palette of cool tones of blue, brown, and grey. This was also characteristic of Analytic Cubism because a simplified color palette further emphasized the structure of the forms. What distinguished the portrait was the contrast produced by the blues, browns, and grey that gave the colors a luminous quality.

The painting was also an homage to Picasso as an artist, and more specifically it relates to the portraits Picasso painted in 1910: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-ambroise-vollard-1910][i]Portrait of Ambroise Vollard[/i][/url] (1910), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-daniel-henry-kahnweiler-1910][i]Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler[/i][/url] (1910), and [[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-wilhelm-uhde-1910]i]Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde[/i][/url] (1910). [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] was also linked to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger/le-go-ter-1911][i]Tea Time[/i][/url] (1911), a portrait by French painter and theorist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger]Jean Metzinger[/url]. According to some scholars, Gris was so impressed by [i]Tea Time[/i] that he became convinced of the importance of mathematics, and the two paintings have a similar grid structure. [i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i] was an artistic homage to Picasso’s innovations, who with Georges Braque paved the way for other Cubist painters like Gris. At the same time, the painting showed Gris’s artistic skill and maturity and is considered one of his early artistic achievements."
The Table,Gris Juan,Synthetic Cubism,still life,"[i]The Table[/i] (1914) by Juan Gris is an example of [i]papier collé[/i] (cut and pasted paper), a form of collage that was first used by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubist[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Georges Braque[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque/fruitdish-and-glass-1912][i]Fruit Dish and Glass[/i][/url] (1912). Following the example Braque and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], Gris began experimenting with collage in 1913. In [i]The Table[/i], he created a complex structure of intersecting diagonals, verticals, and horizontals within a perfect oval, that suggested the shape of the table. In the work, Gris incorporated a fragmented headline of a newspaper article, ‘[i]Le Vrai et le Faux[/i]’, which means ‘the true and the false’ in French. In this way, the artist made a playful statement, communicating to the viewer that the subject of the painting is the contradiction of truths and falsehoods. 

In addition to the newspaper, Gris also pasted book pages onto the canvas. The pages pasted at the bottom of the painting were from one of the [i]Fantômas[/i] novels written by Pierre Souvestre and Marcel Allain. The novels center around the character Fantômas, a master criminal and ruthless killer that spreads terror across Paris. The crime novels deal with the mysterious identity of Fantômas, and like the newspaper headline, it relates to the idea of truths and falsehoods. This is not the first time the artist incorporated pages of contemporary literature into his work. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/the-watch-the-sherry-bottle-1912][i]The watch[/i][/url] (1912), Gris pasted on the canvas titles of two poems, [i]Le Pont Mirabeau[/i] and [i]L’Enfer[/i] by the influential French poet and art critic Guillaume Apollinaire. This practice was a way to give the painting additional layers of meaning, and art historian Christopher Green noted that Gris works often contained vague references to himself. For example, in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/breakfast-1914][i]Breakfast[/i][/url] (1914) the word ‘Gris’ is pasted under the letters ‘ourn’, that were pasted from a newspaper headline. The letters ‘ourn’ are a phonetic imitation of the artist’s name ‘Juan’. Similarly, in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/musician-s-table-1914][i]Musician’s Table[/i][/url] (1914), Gris combined two different headlines to refer to the mounting tensions around the world, as well as the mounting rivalry between his Cubists colleagues, Picasso and Braque.

In the case of [i]The Table[/i] (1914), some have suggested that Gris referred to his status in the Cubist art movement. Gris had great admiration for Picasso and Braque, the two founders of Cubism. He was six years younger than the two artists, and he devoted his full attention to painting only in 1911. The following year he made his artistic debut at the Salon of Independent Artists with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/portrait-of-pablo-picasso-1912][i]The Portrait of Pablo Picasso[/i][/url] (1912). Even though Gris's artworks were on par in terms of quality with those of Picasso and Braque, many of his contemporaries did not see him as an equal of them. It is reasonable to assume Gris felt overlooked, thus the idea of truths and falsehoods in [i]The Table[/i] was a way to assert that he is a ‘true’ Cubist worthy of acknowledgment. True to the Cubist spirit, [i]The Table[/i] functions like a puzzle: the artist leaves hints for the viewer to decipher the mysterious meaning of the artwork."
Still Life,Gris Juan,Synthetic Cubism,still life,"[i]Still Life[/i] (1916) by Juan Gris is a typical example of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetic-cubism]Synthetic Cubism[/url], a late stage of Cubism that was prompted by experiments with collage and, more specifically,  [i]papier collé[/i] (cut and pasted paper). Following the example set by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]George Braque[/url], Gris began to make collages in 1913. However, unlike Picasso and Braque, Gris’s engagement with collage was short-lived, and he soon returned to painting. Nonetheless, paintings like [i]Still Life[/i] demonstrate a continuing connection between Gris’s painting and collage. Gris deconstructed the objects depicted in [i]Still Life[/i] into sharp-edged geometric shapes, that resembled collage fragments.

The invention of collage introduced new materials like newspapers and wallpapers into artworks. Even though Gris painted Still Life after he stopped making collages, he simulated some of the effects achieved in his collages, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/not_detected_207833][i]Still Life (The Table)[/i][/url] (1914). The wallpaper used in [i]Still Life (The Table)[/i] is echoed in the yellow and brown imitation of wood graining in the 1916 [i]Still Life[/i]. Additionally, the dotted passages in the painting resemble the speckled wallpaper seen in Picasso’s [i]papier collé[/i] work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/pipe-and-musical-score-pipe-and-sheet-music-1914][i]Pipe and Musical Score[/i][/url] (1914). At the same time, these dotted passages also resemble the pointillist technique used by Neo-Impressionists. 

Another characteristic of Synthetic Cubism is a richer color palette, and in [i]Still Life[/i], Gris uses bright tones of green, yellow, and blue that are offset by the patches of black. In earlier stages of Cubism, the color palette tended to be limited to draw more attention to the structural elements of the composition. In contrast, Synthetic Cubism emphasized the flat qualities of the image and thus allowed a more open approach to color. [i]Still Life[/i] illustrates this difference: while in earlier Cubist paintings, the spatial illusion was created by the dark and light modeling, in works like [i]Still Life[/i] the spatial illusion emerges from the interplay of the flat geometric shapes. In the painting, Gris was able to represent shading through the black patches and the dotted passages. For example, the neck of the bottle in [i]Still Life[/i] is represented by the green dots against the light-yellow background on the left, and the solid green patch on the right. Because the dotted passages imitated the speckled wallpaper used in Cubist collages, they also added a decorative dimension to the painting.

Still Life demonstrates the innovations of Synthetic Cubism: there was no longer an attempt to create the illusion of three-dimensional space and instead, painters like Gris emphasized the flatness of the surface. It also shows Gris’s affinity and understanding of color, as well as his ability to integrate elements of collage into the medium of painting. Paintings like Still Life, that Gris painted between 1913 and 1918 are widely considered to be the height of his artistic achievements. Today, the painting belongs to the art collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts."
The Coffee Mill,Gris Juan,Synthetic Cubism,still life,"[i]The Coffee Mill[/i] (1916) is an example of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetic-cubism]Synthetic Cubism[/url], a late phase of Cubism that was a result of artistic experiments by Gris, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Georges Braque[/url]. Gris fully devoted himself to painting in 1911, intending to develop his unique Cubist style. A close friend of Picasso, Gris followed his and Braque’s example and began making collages in 1913. This was also a particularly significant period for Gris since it is generally acknowledged that he produced his best work between 1913 and 1918. The experiments with collage and, in particular,  [i]papier collé[/i] (cut and pasted paper) were crucial to the development of Synthetic Cubism. While the focus of the earlier [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/analytical-cubism]Analytical Cubism[/url] was to represent a single object from different points of view and create a fragmented image, Synthetic Cubism emphasized the flat qualities of the image and eliminated the illusion of three-dimensional space. In the context of Synthetic Cubism, Gris was known for his theoretical approach and inclination towards the conceptual aspects of Cubism.

These aspects are embodied in the precisely structured forms and the architectural composition of [i]The Coffee Mill[/i]. Painted in May 1916, it depicts a coffee mill, a bottle, and a wine glass on a table covered with a green cloth. The objects represented in the painting were probably present in the artist’s studio. This was a motif that appeared in many of his artworks, such as the sketch [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/still-life-with-coffee-mill-1916][i]Still Life with Coffee Mill[/i][/url] (1916) and the compositions [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/the-coffee-grinder-1916][i]Coffee Grinder, Cup and Glass on a Table[/i][/url] (1915-1916), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/coffee-grinder-and-glass-1915][i]Coffee Grinder and Glass[/i][/url] (1915). [i]The Coffee Mill[/i] is mainly composed of diagonals that offset each other: the mill and the bottle lean toward the right, while the table and the wall surface lean toward the left. Gris amplified this structure of diagonal movements with the curved shapes of the coffee mill and the bottle. Gris probably painted the image by manipulating the colors and shapes until they began to suggest the objects he depicted. In [i]The Coffee Mill[/i], Gris takes this process to the extreme: the objects are fragmented to the point that they become almost indecipherable. This demonstrates Gris’s shift toward a more conceptual approach: he was mainly interested in the formal structure of the painting and in emphasizing the flat quality of the surface.

At the same time, Gris wanted to express the sensuous qualities of painting: this was accomplished through the lush tones of red and green as well as the addition of texture through the simulated wood pattern. The addition of texture was likely influenced by collage, a technique that incorporated new materials like newspapers and wallpapers into artworks. In [i]The Coffee Mill[/i], the wood grain pattern on the coffee mill’s base might have been inspired by Picasso’s collage [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guitar-sheet-music-and-wine-glass-1912][i]Guitar, Sheet music, and Wine glass[/i][/url] (1912). Today, [i]The Coffee Mill[/i] belongs to the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art."
Harlequin,Gris Juan,Cubism,sculpture,"[i]Harlequin[/i] (1917) is a significant work in Juan Gris’s legacy, as it is one of his rare attempts at sculpture. [i]Harlequin[/i] was created at an important stage of Gris’s artistic career. He spent the duration of World War I (1914-1918) in France, where he had the opportunity to forge close connections with avant-garde artists like artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Henri Matisse[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-metzinger]Jean Metzinger[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-lipchitz]Jacques Lipchitz[/url]. His friendship with Lipchitz, a cubist sculptor, was particularly relevant to the creation of [i]Harlequin[/i]. The two met in 1916 and were both parts of the famed artistic community of the Montmartre neighborhood in Paris. While working on the plaster sculpture Gris encountered technical difficulties and was able to complete the work with Lipchitz’s help. Gris constructed the sculpture according to the principles of the golden ratio: he carved and reworked the plaster until he achieved the desired form, after which he painted the sculpture in muted colors. Lipchitz assisted Gris with the armatures, the framework on which the sculpture is built. Because the two were very close, it is possible Gris was also influenced by Lipchitz’s sculptures: there are some stylistic similarities between [i]Harlequin[/i] and Lipchitz’s works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-lipchitz/seated-figure-1917][i]Seated Figure[/i][/url] (1917) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-lipchitz/the-man-with-the-mandolin-1917][i]The Man with the Mandolin[/i][/url] (1917). 

The Harlequin is a character from the [i]Commedia dell'arte[/i], an Italian theatrical form that was popular throughout Europe between the 16th and 18th centuries. As a character, the Harlequin is known for his trickery; he is often driven by impulse and passion. Modern artists were drawn to the character and often depicted the Harlequin, for example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/harlequin-1915][i]Harlequin[/i][/url] (1915) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne/harlequin-1890-1][i]Harlequin[/i][/url] (1890). Gris was very fond of the Harlequin, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/all-works#!#filterName:Theme_harlequin,resultType:masonry]portraying the subject[/url] in approximately forty works created between 1917 and 1925: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/harlequin-with-a-guitar][i]Harlequin with a Guitar[/i][/url] (1917) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/harlequin-at-a-table-1919][i]Harlequin at a Table[/i][/url] (1919) are notable examples. In a way, [i]Harlequin[/i] serves as an extension of these paintings, translating cubist concepts from two dimensional to three-dimensional medium. The Cubist approach aimed to liberate sculpture from the limitation of a naturalistic perspective. In [i]Harlequin[/i], Gris created geometric forms to capture the figure simultaneously from multiple perspectives. The high quality of [i]Harlequin[/i] was not enough to deepen Gris’s interest in sculpture, who remained most devoted to painting, and was hesitant to pursue projects that interfered with his painting. Furthermore, for Gris, the process of sculpting was a struggle, which is probably why he generally avoided working in the medium.

For many years it was believed that [i]Harlequin[/i] was the only sculpture made by Gris. However, recently another sculpture by Gris resurfaced, the bronze sculpture [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/harlequin-1918][i]Harlequin[/i][/url] (c.1917-1918), which was executed around the same time as the plaster [i]Harlequin[/i]. The bronze and plaster sculptures closely relate to each other, as is most evident in the similarity of the composition. Today, the plaster sculpture Harlequin belongs to the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art."
Crucifixion,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,figurative,"'Crucifixion' is the work that first launched Bacon into the public eye, long before the much greater successes of the post-war years. The painting may have been inspired by Rembrandt's  [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt/the-carcass-of-an-ox-1657]Slaughtered Ox[/url] (c.1638), but also by Picasso's Surrealist style (perhaps sensing this latter connection, Herbert Read, in his book Art Now, illustrated 'Crucifixion' adjacent to a Picasso's  [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/bather-with-beach-ball-1932]Bather[/url]). The translucent whiteness painted over the bodily frame in 'Crucifixion' adds a ghostly touch to an already unsettling composition, introducing Bacon's obsession with pain and fear. Exhibited at a time when the horrors of the First World War were still remembered, 'Crucifixion' spoke of how brutality had changed the world forever. At the time of writing the picture is owned by [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/damien-hirst]Damien Hirst[/url], an artist who has acknowledged a large debt to Bacon."
Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,figurative,"The triptych painting [i]Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion[/i] (ca. 1944) by Francis Bacon is a pivotal work in the artist’s career, that is widely considered as Bacon’s first mature piece. Bacon’s crucifixion depicts distorted and deformed figures against a hot orange background. Despite the title, Bacon stated that the painting did not directly relate to the crucifixion. The artist stressed that as a non believer, he treated the crucifixion as an act of human behavior rather than an event of religious significance. He also connected the image to Greek mythology and Aeschylus’s trilogy of tragedies, the [i]Oresteia[/i]: the distorted figures were inspired by the Furies, mythical creatures of revenge who pursue Orestes in [i]The Eumenides[/i]. 

The painting was first exhibited at the [i]Lefevre Gallery[/i] in London in April 1945 alongside works of more established artists: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frances-hodgkins]France Hodgkins[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/matthew-smith]Matthew Smith[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henry-moore]Henry Moore[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/graham-sutherland]Graham Sutherland[/url]. The critic John Russell recalled the painting’s strong impact and many shocked and disturbed reactions from the critics and the public. Significantly, the exhibition coincided with the final days of World War II, and the incoming information about German concentration camps that were liberated by the Allies. Even though the distorted figures in [i]Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion[/i] have no direct connection to the shocking images of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, the painting is often analyzed in the context of World War II. Some scholars suggest that the painting reflects the pessimism felt after the events of the Holocaust and the advent of nuclear weapons. 

Bacon’s pictorial language in [i]Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion[/i] has been linked to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism#!#resultType:masonry]Surrealism[/url], and the distorted figures were compared to those of Surrealist painters [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali]Salvador Dalí[/url]. However Bacon preferred to distance himself from Surrealism: he was more interested in the Surrealist artistic language than the movement’s ideas and concepts. Another important influence was [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url] and his pictures of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/head-1929]biomorphic forms from the late 1920s[/url] and mid 1930s. Most notably, similarities are found between the forms in Picasso’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/crucifixion-1930][i]Crucifixion[/i][/url] (1930) and Bacon’s triptych. Building on Picasso exploration of forms, Bacon furthered the possibilities of painting organic forms that relate to but also distorts the human image. 

Bacon’s extreme distortion of forms creates a disturbing effect that left many startled and troubled by the image. Still, [i]Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion[/i] received critical and institutional recognition, in 1954 the triptych was included in Bacon’s section of the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale. However, both at the Venice and São Paulo Biennale the title of the painting was changed to [i]Three Studies for a Larger Composition[/i], in order to minimize potential offense or controversy. Often times Bacon painted additional versions of his major works, revisiting and developing important themes in his art. During the 1960s, he painted more versions of the theme, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-for-a-crucifixion-1962][i]Three Studies for a Crucifixion[/i][/url] (1962) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/crucifixion-1965][i]Crucifixion[/i][/url] (1965) and in the 1980s he revisited the composition more literally in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/second-version-of-triptych-1944-1988][i]Second Version of Triptych 1944[/i][/url] (1988)."
Painting,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,"allegorical painting, symbolic painting","The layered images of this enigmatic painting blend into each other, giving it a dreamlike (or nightmarish) quality. From the top, the outstretched wings of a bird skeleton seem to be perched upon a hanging carcass, the latter motif influenced, like Bacon's Crucifixion from 1933, by Rembrandt. In the foreground, a well-dressed man under an umbrella sits in a circular enclosure which might be decorated with more bones and another carcass. The strange, collage-like composition of this work reveals Bacon's method. ""The one like a butcher's shop, it came to me as an accident,"" he once said of the picture. ""I was attempting to make a bird alighting on a field. And it may have been bound up in some way with the three forms that had gone before, but suddenly the lines that I'd drawn suggested something totally different, and out of this suggestion rose the picture. I had no intention to do this picture; I never thought of it in that way. It was like one continuous accident mounting on top of another."""
Study for a Portrait,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,figurative,"Francis Bacon’s painting [i]Study for a Portrait[/i] (1952), at times known as [i]Businessman I[/i] or [i]Man’s Head[/i] deals with the motif of the scream, an important and recurring visual in Bacon’s body of work. The painting depicts the head and shoulders of a screaming male figure, who wears glasses, a suit and a tie. [i]Study for a Portrait[/i] can be viewed as part of Bacon’s development in the genre of portraiture. Bacon’s engagement with the motif of a head in isolation began in 1948, and his first identifiable portrait was of his close friend Lucian Freud, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/portrait-of-lucian-freud-1951][i]Portrait of Lucian Freud[/i][/url] (1951). Even though Freud and others posed for Bacon, the artist often preferred to work with photographic sources. 

The motif of the screaming mouth became an important theme in Bacon’s art in the late 1940s and early 1950s in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/study-after-velazquezs-portrait-of-pope-innocent-x-1953][i]Study after Velazquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X[/i][/url] (1953) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-of-the-human-head-1953][i]Three Studies of the Human Head[/i][/url] (1953). In 1949 the critic Robert Melville suggested a connection between Bacon’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/head-vi-1949][i]Head VI[/i][/url] (1949) and a scene from [i]Battleship Potemkin[/i] (1925), a film by Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein. The film was based on the events of a 1905 mutiny of the crew of the Russian battleship [i]Potemkin[/i]. In the film, after the crew rebels against the officers, the Tsars soldiers carry out a massacre on the vast stairway in the city of Odessa. Although Bacon saw the film in 1935, he painted from the still images in Roger Melville’s 1944 book [i]Film[/i]. He was particularly interested in the image of a wounded, elderly nurse, who wears cracked glasses and has blood running down her face into her open screaming mouth. This was possibly one of the images that inspired [i]Study for a Portrait[/i]. Other paintings by Bacon  such as [i]Study After Velazquez’s Portrait of Innocent X[/i] (1953) have also been linked to the image of the nurse from Battleship Potemkin. Bacon’s interest in the human mouth was also sometimes associated with a book Bacon bought in 1935 that featured sections about diseases of the mouth.

In [i]Study for a Portrait[/i] Bacon employed the ‘space frame’ technique, that creates the illusion of a figure trapped in a transparent cage. Bacon’s use of ‘space framers’ was probably influenced by both contemporary works, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti/cage][i]Cage[/i][/url] (1930-1931) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti]Alberto Giacometti[/url] as well as Renaissance paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/filippo-archinto][i]Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto[/i][/url] (ca. 1558) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url]. For Bacon this pictorial device served as a visual representation of psychological entrapment.Bacon’s subject in the [i]Study for a Portrait[/i] is a suited man, a recurring theme in Bacon’s work, for example in his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/all-works#!#filterName:Series_man-in-blue,resultType:masonry][i]Man in Blue[/i][/url] series painted in 1954. In paintings [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/man-in-blue-i-1954][i]Man in Blue I[/i][/url] (1954) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/man-in-blue-v-1954][i]Man in Blue V[/i][/url] (1954), the suited man can be interpreted in two roles, that of an ‘interrogator’ and of a ‘victim’.  [i]Study for a Portrait[/i] is one of paintings in which Bacon explores themes of isolation and madness."
Dog,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,animal painting,"Bacon used a variety of strategies to represent what one commentator described as 'the anguish of contemporary life'. Here we see his use of animals to evoke aggression, vulnerability or both. The image of the dog derived from Eadward Muybridge's time-lapse photographs of animals in motion. Bacon smeared the paint to suggest what seems to be demented movement. In contrast the setting, depicted with an economy of means, was based on the sea front in Monte Carlo, where he had lived from 1946 to 1950."
Two Figures,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,genre painting,"Due to its homosexual overtones, the inaugural exhibition of Two Figures caused an uproar. Drawn from studies of anatomical drawings and Eadweard Muybridge's motion photography, Two Figures is as much an exploration of the body in action as it is a representation of the physical act of love. The two figures entwined in bed are covered by Bacon's ""curtain"" of striated lines, which both obstructs the view and enhances the movement of the figures. Instead of evoking the romance of a nighttime rendezvous, the dark colors of the painting allude to a more sinister encounter."
Study after Velazquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,symbolic painting,"As the title suggests, Francis Bacon’s [i]Study After Velazquez’s Portrait of Innocent X [/i](1953) was inspired by the 17th century portrait [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez/portrait-of-pope-innocent-x-1650][i]Pope Innocent X[/i][/url] (1650) by Spanish painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Diego Velazquez[/url]. In fact, Bacon was fascinated with the figure of the Pope throughout the 1950s and and the early 1960s, painting around fifty portraits of the subject matter. One of the starting points for this series was Velazquez’s portrait: Bacon was transfixed with the painting keeping several reproductions in his studio. However, while visiting Rome in 1954, he chose not see the original painting at the [i]Galleria Doria Pamphilj[/i]. Velazquez, who painted the Pope at the height of his political power, created a portrait that embodied his authority and status as a spiritual leader. Bacon’s [i]Study After Velazquez’s Portrait of Innocent X[/i] shatters this image with the depiction of the screaming Pope. 

His papal portrait presents a critical perspective of traditional papal portraits, as well as a broader critique of Christianity. For Bacon, the Pope is a kind of tragic figure, that renounces all individuality and self-identity to uphold a public role of a stifling belief system. This system of oppression is the source of violence Bacon portrays in [i]Study After Velazquez’s Portrait of Innocent X[/i]. By painting vertical folds of color, he creates a unique pictorial space that gives the illusion of an isolated space or cage - a pictorial device known as ‘space frames’. Bacon’s use of ‘space frames’ relates to the work of his contemporary, Italian sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti]Alberto Giacometti[/url]. The ‘space-frame’ was a motif in Giacometti’s sculpture [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti/cage][i]Cage[/i][/url] (1930-31) and a framing device in his later paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alberto-giacometti/diego-seated-1948][i]Diego Seated[/i][/url] (1948). The technique of distancing the figure was applied by Old Masters, for instance [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian]Titian[/url] in his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/titian/filippo-archinto][i]Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto[/i][/url] (ca. 1558). 

In Bacon’s case the ‘space frame’ can be a visual representation of psychological entrapment, which is also conveyed through the Pope’s chilling cry of horror. The screaming Pope can be linked to post existential [i]angst[/i] and Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept of the ‘death of God’. Bacon, a staunch atheist, exposes the Pope as an empty symbol by visually deconstructing the powerful figure portrayed by Velazquez. 

The disintegrated figure in [i]Study After Velazquez’s Portrait of Innocent X[/i] is traced to Bacon’s earlier painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/head-iv-1949][i]Head VI[/i][/url] (1949). This was the first time Bacon referenced Velazquez’s Pope Innocent X. The study of the head develops into a full portrait in [i]Study After Velazquez’s Portrait of Innocent X[/i]. In both paintings color played an important role in transforming Velazquez’s dignified portrait painted in soft and muted tones. Bacon used a garish purple to replace the lush red of the Pope’s cape, and he heightened the color contrast with the translucent yellow and gold throne. The purple cape in particular is recurring in Bacon’s papal portraits, for example [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/pope-i-1951][i]Pope I[/i][/url] (1951) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/untitled-pope-1954][i]Untitled (Pope)[/i][/url] (c.1954). The glaring colors against the dark background heighten the sense of drama, and enhance the disturbing atmosphere evoked by Bacon’s portrait."
Study for a Portrait of Van Gogh IV,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,"portrait, sketch and study","The painting [i]Study for portrait of Van Gogh IV[/i] (1957) by Francis Bacon is one of six canvases the artist dedicated to the subject. All six paintings were inspired by Vincent Van Gogh’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh/selfportrait-on-the-road-to-tarascon-the-painter-on-his-way-to-work-1888][i]The Painter on the Road to Tarascon[/i][/url] (1888), a painting that was destroyed during World War II. Bacon confirmed that he never saw that painting and instead he worked from a reproduction. [i]The Painter on the Road to Tarascon[/i] is an unusual example of a self portrait, in that the figure is painted  in a landscape setting. The figure is seen at a distance, but Van Gogh’s shows an extension of his personality through the dark shadow of the figure. 

In Bacon’s versions, including [i]Study for portrait of Van Gogh IV[/i], the road tends to rise steeply, and the figure is much larger within the composition. Bacon also painted the figure in various poses and cleverly reinvented the element of the shadow in each painting. Through his interpretations of [i]The Painter on the Road to Tarascon[/i] Bacon explored themes of isolation: [i]‘I’ve always liked early Van Gogh best, but that haunted figure on the road seemed just right at the time - like a phantom of the road, you could say.’[/i] While Bacon engaged with themes of madness and isolation throughout his career, the series placed these concepts in the specific context of Van Gogh’s biography. The idea of the ‘haunted figure’ aligns with the overall perception of Van Gogh as a misunderstood and ultimately tragic genius. Bacon’s series engages with this narrative by presenting the artists as a lone traveller, a solitary figure separate from mainstream society. In [i]Study for portrait of Van Gogh IV[/i], the painter is a lone figure surrounded by dark shadows that give a sense of anguish and disquiet. By playing up the idea of ‘the haunted figure’ and emulating Van Gogh's style and technique, Bacon managed to fuse Van Gogh’s artistic identity with his own. 

Most of the paintings were completed in the course of two weeks in 1957 as Bacon was rushing to fill an exhibition at the [i]Hanover Gallery[/i] in London. Bacon completed the series during the course of the exhibition, adding two more paintings to the space after the opening. This series provoked a shift in Bacon’s style and technique: his brushwork became more expressive, his colors more lively and he used the impasto technique associated with Van Gogh’s style. This shift however is not solely attributed to Van Gogh, the use of color and its application was also influenced by the works of painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chaim-soutine]Chaim Soutine[/url]. Another formative experience in Bacon’s transition was his visit to Morocco - the fierce and bright light of Tangier influenced his departure from a previously sombre palette of famous works such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/painting-1946][i]Painting[/i][/url] (1946), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/figure-with-meat-1954][i]Figure with Meat[/i][/url] (1954) and the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/head-iv-1949][i]Head series[/i][/url] (1949)."
Study for the Nurse in the film 'Battleship Potemkin',Bacon Francis,Expressionism,sketch and study,"Sergei Eisentstein’s 1925 silent film the “Battleship Potemkin” was an influential work for Bacon, who was inspired by one particular image of the film as a catalyst for many of his works. The particular image is the screaming face of the nurse in the film. Her face is bloody and her glasses are crushed against the right side of her face, mouth frozen open in a silent scream of terror. Bacon saw the film for the first time in 1935, and thereafter kept a photographic still of the nurse’s screaming face as inspiration for his later works."
"Landscape near Malabata, Tangier",Bacon Francis,Expressionism,landscape,"On the opening day of Bacon's first major retrospective at the Tate Gallery, amidst telegrams of congratulation, one message informed him of the death of Peter Lacy in Tangier. He had parted company with Lacy some years before, and his death from drink had not been difficult to predict, yet Bacon was nonetheless deeply affected. In 1963 he painted the dark and ambiguous Landscape near Malabata, Tangier in memory of Lacy’s final resting place."
Portrait of George Dyer Crouching,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,portrait,"Bacon was in his 60s when he met the young George Dyer. Their relationship, although romantic, always had the sense of a father-son dynamic. Dyer was constantly in need of attention and reassurance, and the naked embryonic form kneeling precariously on a ledge expresses his vulnerability. The circular sofa, however, surrounds him in a protective embrace. Uncharacteristically, the coloring is light and subdued, although the red and green highlights hint at an inner struggle. Dyer suffered from a lifelong addiction to drugs and alcohol, which is alluded to by the painted figure looking downward into a central abyss."
Study for Head of George Dyer,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,sketch and study,"Created at the height of their love affair, this painting was of Bacon’s close companion and lover, George Dyer, who modeled for many of Bacon’s paintings, becoming a dominating presence in many of them. They had a tumultuous relationship at best. As Dyer began drinking more heavily, their relationship deteriorated to the point that all Bacon did was support Dyer’s drinking habits. He began to be a nuisance for bacon and his artist friends, and Bacon began painting him less and less. Dyer, feeling the sting of rejection, attempted to get Bacon’s attention by attempting suicide a number of times, and once planting cannabis in Bacon’s apartment and calling the police. In October 1971, the night before Bacon’s exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris, Dyer overdosed on barbiturates, killing himself. Although the loss affected him deeply, Bacon remained stoic throughout the exhibition and the ensuing media frenzy and funeral. Dyer’s death had a prevailing influence on Bacon’s later works, which were haunted by death and despair."
Triptych – August 1972,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,figurative,"Francis Bacon’s [i]Triptych - August 1972[/i] (1972) consists of three panels that depict male figures in a domestic setting. The triptych is a popular format in Bacon’s art, and the format of some of his prominent works like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-for-figures-at-the-base-of-a-crucifixion-1944][i]Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion[/i][/url] (1944), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-for-a-crucifixion-1962][i]Three Studies for a Crucifixion[/i][/url] (1962) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/study-for-three-heads-1962][i]Study for Three Heads[/i][/url] (1962). The three-part composition appealed to Bacon because of its ability to isolate and juxtapose the figures in a way that downplayed the narrative qualities of his paintings. 

The central panel presents an entanglement of two bodies that likely depict a homosexual coupling. The motif of the central panel is similar to that of an earlier painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/triptych-studies-from-the-human-body-1970-0][i]Triptych - Studies from the Human Body[/i][/url] (1970) - the central panel of the painting portrays similar organic forms that meld into one. When talking about the motif in  [i]Triptych - Studies from the Human Body[/i], Bacon stated that he wanted to ‘[i]make an image which coagulated this sensation of two people in some form of sexual act on the bed[/i]’. Thus it is likely, he had similar intentions when painting [i]Triptych - August 1972[/i] (1972). Bacon composed this distorted image by adapting the pose from one of his favourite photographic sources, ‘[i]Some Phases in a Wrestling[/i]’ from Eadweard Muybridge’s sequential photographs that were published in [i]The Human Figure in Motion[/i]. Bacon owned a copy of the book, and has described these photographs as a ‘dictionary’ of human motion. The photographs were a source for earlier painting from the 1950s, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/two-figures-1953][i]Two Figures[/i][/url] (1953) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/two-figures-in-the-grass-1954][i]Two Figures in the Grass[/i][/url] (1954). In reviewing all of the paintings, Bacon’s figures gradually lose their separate identities and ultimately liquify into one another in the triptychs. 

The painting [i]Triptych - August 1972[/i] along with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/triptych-in-memory-of-george-dyer-1971][i]In Memory of George Dyer[/i][/url] (1971) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/triptych-may-june-1973][i]Triptych. May-June 1973[/i][/url] (1973) are at times called [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/all-works#!#filterName:Series_black-triptychs-1972-1974,resultType:masonry][i]‘The Black Triptychs’[/i][/url] (referring to the black backgrounds of the paintings). This grouping identifies these paintings as Bacon’s reaction to the 1971 suicide of his former lover and model, George Dyer. However, this grouping is sometimes challenged for being inaccurate or incomplete. Other works from the period such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/figure-in-movement-1972][i]Figure in Movement[/i][/url] (1972) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/three-studies-of-figures-on-beds-1972-0][i]Three Studies of Figures on Beds[/i][/url] (1972) also deal with the events of Dyer’s death point to the fact that Bacon did not conceive [i]‘The Black Triptychs’[/i] as a series. Furthermore, Hugh Davies (art critic who made the initial identification of the grouping) revised his position stating that [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/triptych-march-1974-1974][i]Triptych, March 1974[/i][/url] (1974) is the final triptych of the series instead of [i]Triptych. May-June 1973[/i]. Therefore, there is no clear evidence that Bacon intended these works to function as a sequence. In the case of [i]Triptych August 1972[/i], Bacon commented that he used black for the background for aesthetic rather than symbolic reasons."
Triptych August 1972,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,figurative,"This work is generally considered one in a series of Black Triptychs which followed the suicide of Bacon’s lover, George Dyer. Dyer appears on the left and Bacon is on the right. The central group is derived from a photograph of wrestlers by Edward Muybridge, but also suggests a more sexual encounter. The seated figures and their coupling are set against black voids and the central flurry has been seen as ‘a life-and death struggle’."
Study for Self-Portrait,Bacon Francis,Expressionism,sketch and study,"Contemporarily held in a private collection, this set of triptychs is both Bacon’s most personal and least experimental paintings. It was created during after a time in which Bacon had lost many close friends, and examines themes of life and death, and the effect of age on the human physique. During the 1970’s Bacon lost his close companion George Dyer, and in the 1980’s, his sister Winifred, as well as other close friends passed away. He was quoted as saying that he was reduced to paint only self portraits because so many people around him had died that the only person he had left to paint was himself."

Look Mickey,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,genre painting,"At age 38, Roy Lichtenstein created the breakthrough painting [i]Look Mickey[/i] (1961) that declared the emergence of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] style. Lichtenstein appropriated the scene from popular culture, showing two Disney icons, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in a humorous situation. In the painting, Mickey and Donald are on a pier: Donald swings the fishing pole above his head thinking he caught a fish when in fact he snagged his coattail. Mickey tries to stifle his laughter while Donald naively says in the bubble text: “Look Mickey, I’ve hooked a big one”.
Multiple stories were told about the origins of the legendary painting: Lichtenstein discovered the image in a bubble gum wrapper, the idea came about during a drawing game with his children or he was inspired by a conversation with the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/allan-kaprow]Allan Kaprow[/url]. Most likely, the source was an illustration in the 1960s children's book [i]Donald Duck: Lost and Found[/i]. Lichtenstein’s interest in the subject, that culminated in the painting [i]Look Mickey[/i] (1961), began four years earlier. In 1957 he used a projector to trace a large image of Mickey Mouse on his son’s bedroom wall. The characters of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Bugs Bunny were featured in earlier works: a series of paintings that were later destroyed, and drawings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/mickey-mouse-i-1958][i]Mickey Mouse I[/i][/url] (1958) that mixed coarse strokes of pastel, crayon, and ink.

In [i]Look Mickey[/i], Lichtenstein explored the idea of mechanical reproduction in the printing process, imitating the technique through the language of painting. He hand-painted dots on Mickey’s face and in Donald’s eyes mimicking the ink dots of the Ben-Day printing process that was used in the production of inexpensive comic books and magazines. The artist made subtle changes to the original image in order to present a more cohesive image. He omitted background figures, rotated the point of view by 90 degrees, and limited his palette to the three primary colors and white. By appropriating an image from popular culture, and placing it in the context of fine art, Lichtenstein injected irony and humor into the painting. Lichtenstein’s image is ambiguous, the viewer can identify both with the narrator, Mickey, and the victim, Donald.

The painting represented a radical stylistic shift in Lichtenstein’s art, who hoped that by presenting something completely different he would break through to the forefront of mainstream art. Lichtenstein admitted that the painting reflected his feelings on his professional status: “The subject of the painting is me”. In this way, the two characters can represent Lichtenstein’s sentiment toward this artistic experiment. Donald’s enthusiastic attempt represents his ambition and hope for an artistic breakthrough, while Mickey represents the sobering reality and possibility that it might fail miserably.

[i]Look Mickey[/i] brought Lichtenstein the mainstream success he hoped for, but it also received harsh criticism. He was criticized for counterfeiting commercial images, and famously an art critic called him one of the worst artists in America. Art historians and critics regard [i]Look Mickey[/i] as revolutionary work that announced the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] movement. The artist highlighted the significance of the painting in a later work, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/artists-studio-look-mickey-1973][i]Artist's Studio—Look Mickey [/i][/url] (1973), in which the painting is featured prominently on the back wall."
Woman with Flowered Hat,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,portrait,"From the early 1960s and onwards, Roy Lichtenstein began to explore art as a theme by reinterpreting masterpieces of artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]. Between 1962 and 1963, Lichtenstein created four paintings based on Picasso’s portraits of women, the last of which is [i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i] (1963).  The painting is based on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/dora-maar-with-cat-1941][i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i][/url] (1941), a portrait of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dora-maar]Dora Maar[/url], the Surrealist artist who was Picasso’s lover and muse from 1936 to the mid-1940s.

The tumultuous and at times abusive relationship between Picasso and Maar was reflected in Picasso’s depictions of Maar. In [i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i] and other paintings, Picasso depicted his muse as a tormented figure, distorting her features with jagged forms. [i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i] also expressed Picasso’s anxiety and reaction to the troubling events of the time, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II. This angst can be sensed in the spontaneous and emotional nature of the work expressed through bold colors, jagged forms, and dense layers of paint. Lichtenstein possibly was drawn to the portrait because he tended to depict female figures in distress in comic book paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/drowning-girl-1963][i]Drowning Girl[/i][/url] (1963) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/crying-girl-1964][i]Crying Girl[/i][/url] (1964).

In [i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i], Lichtenstein preserved all the main elements of Picasso’s painting but made significant stylistic changes in terms of color, texture, and form. He painted the portrait in his [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] style that was influenced by mass-produced commercial imagery of comic books, cartoons, and advertising. This style was characterized by primary colors, flat uniform planes, black outlines, and hand-painted Ben-Day dots used in the printing process of inexpensive publications. By imitating mass-produced imagery Lichtenstein removes the painterly sensibility expressed by Picasso. His approach is calculated and meticulous, he paints in an impersonal and precise manner.

Lichtenstein conflates Picasso’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cubism]Cubism[/url], a groundbreaking style in Modern art history with the style of cheap commercial publications and advertisements. The artist’s combination of high art and popular imagery was understood as an attack on predecessors like Picasso. However, [i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i] is more of an homage than a parody. Lichtenstein deals with the complex legacy of Picasso by reinterpreting it for the contemporary world saying: “Picasso has become a kind of popular object… one has the feeling there should be a reproduction of Picasso in every home”. By adapting Picasso’s painting to a contemporary society driven by consumerism and mass production, Lichtenstein gives the image new relevance. He explained: “What I wanted to express is not that Picasso was known and therefore commonplace. Nobody thought of Picasso as common. What I am painting is a kind of Picasso done the way a cartoonist does it or the way it might be described to you, so it loses the subtleties of Picasso, but it takes on other characteristics”."
Crying Girl,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,portrait,"Roy Lichtenstein Crying Girl, 1963, an offset lithograph, was one of his earlier forays into pop art. It was originally made as an invitation to his show in New York at the Leo Castelli Gallery. Aside from the invitations which he folded in four, Lichtenstein kept some and signed them. Many of Lichtenstein’s comic inspired paintings and prints dealt with so-called angsting women in one way or another. He would portray a snapshot of a larger narrative and allow the viewer to fill in the remainder. In terms of Crying Girl, 1963, she looks out of the corner of her eyes to the right and holds her hands to her mouth as if muffling a gasp. Tears bead out of the corner of her eyes and the viewer wonders – what is she looking at? Part of what makes Lichtenstein’s works, and Crying Girl, 1963 in particular, so captivating is that they carry such intense emotion, if only for a moment in time."
Whaam!,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,genre painting,"[i]Whaam![/i] (1963) is a two-canvas painting based on an image from the comic book strip [i]All-American Men of War[/i], published by DC Comics in February 1962. The left canvas depicts an American fighter plane firing a missile that hits an approaching enemy plane seen on the right canvas. The bright yellow letters ‘WHAAM!’ blaze out of the exploding airplane, describing the impact of the attack. The artist got the idea for [i]Whaam![/i] while working on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/tex-1962][i]Tex![/i][/url] (1962), a smaller, single panel painting that has a similar composition of a plane shooting at an enemy aircraft. The artist explained the idea of the two-canvas painting in a letter he wrote in 1967: “I remember being concerned with the idea of doing almost separate paintings having a little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course, there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other.”

In the painting, Lichtenstein imitates the tradition of printed comic strips in the thick black lines that outline areas of primary colors, and the uniform areas of Ben-Day dots in the purple shading of the fighter plane and the sky in the background. He found this style of comic book strips and cartoons particularly appealing because it allowed him to depict emotionally charged, dramatic subject matters, like love and war, in a detached and calculated manner. In his paintings, Lichtenstein drew inspiration from popular imagery in advertising, comic books, and cartoons. Although his paintings have an element of appropriation, the artist transformed these images in his paintings. The ‘low’ mass-produced image from a comic book is transferred to the realm of high art in the traditional medium of a large-scale easel painting.

During the first half of the 1960s, Lichtenstein created multiple war paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/bratatat-1963][i]Bratatat![/i][/url] (1963), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/okay-hot-shot-okay-1963][i]Okay Hot-Shot, Okay![/i][/url] (1963) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/as-i-opened-fire-1964][i]As I Opened Fire[/i][/url] (1964). Like [i]Whaam![/i] these were inspired by comic book images that glorified military action and heroism. In Lichtenstein’s paintings, these images become ironic and juvenile. Lichtenstein who served in the US Army between 1943 and 1946, painted these war paintings at a time when the Vietnam War was gaining steam. By emphasizing the irony and ridiculousness of the scenes, the artist deconstructs military heroism and glorified action-packed violence. In a 1963 interview, Lichtenstein stated: “The heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don’t take them seriously in these paintings – maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point.” Therefore, paintings like [i]Whaam![/i] can be interpreted as artworks that emphasize the foolishness and absurdity of war.

The complexity of the [i]Whaam![/i] lies in its contrasts and dualities – an emotionally charged subject presented in a detached style, a commercial image placed in a fine art context, and a mass-produced image becoming a unique artwork in the form of a painting. These dualities were characteristics of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pop-art]Pop art[/url] and were explored by Lichtenstein and his contemporaries, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/claes-oldenburg]Claes Oldenburg[/url]."
Drowning girl,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,genre painting,"[i]Drowning Girl[/i] (1963) is one of the most famous paintings of American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop[/url] artist Roy Lichtenstein. It was based on the cover of the 1962 comic book [i]Run for Love[/i] by DC Comics. Lichtenstein significantly altered the original illustration, which shows the girl drowning in the foreground with her boyfriend in the background clinging to an overturned boat. The narrative text in the illustration presents a melodramatic love story: the girl is drowning because of a leg cramp, but she is so grief-stricken that she decides to drown instead of calling out to her boyfriend for help.

Lichtenstein cropped the image to show only the drowning girl surrounded by a threatening wave. By focusing on the girl’s anguished expression, he heightened the dramatic quality of the image. The artist also altered the text in the thought bubble in two ways: changing the line ‘I don’t care if I have a cramp!” to “I don’t care!” and changing the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad. Lichtenstein found the name Brad more ‘heroic’, reassuring the viewer that the girl will ultimately be saved. Despite these changes, Lichtenstein still preserves the essential narrative of the love comics: a handsome boy and beautiful girl fall in love and a complication arises that threatens their relationship. The heroine is briefly heart-broken and distraught but ultimately gets her happy ending. Lichtenstein captures this sentiment of anguish by focusing on the girl and her emotional reaction. By playing up the melodramatic qualities of the story and the exaggerated behavior of the heroine, Lichtenstein injected irony and humor into the painting.

In terms of style, Lichtenstein mimicked the mass-produced image, by accentuating the thick black outlines and the contrasting colors. He painted the ink dots of the Ben-Day printing process used in the production of inexpensive comic books and magazines. Like in the mechanically produced illustration, the dots in the painting give the illusion of shading, which is visible in the red spots on the girl’s skin and lips, and the grayish tones of the water. In this way, the painting conflates between the mechanical printing process and the traditional technique of oil painting, and between the mass-produced image in the comic book and the unique artwork.

Like [i]Drowning girl[/i], many of Lichtenstein’s early paintings were based on imagery found in cartoons and comic books. He found the style of comic books and cartoons appealing because it allowed him to depict emotionally charged, dramatic subject matters, like love and war, in a detached and calculated manner. Lichtenstein’s art created a dialogue between fine art and popular imagery. In the case of [i]Drowning girl[/i], he stated that the woodblock print, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/the-great-wave-of-kanagawa-1831][i]The Great Wave off Kanagawa[/i][/url] (1831) by the Japanese artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai]Hokusai[/url] was one of the inspirations for the stylized waves. Hokusai’s prints were a form of the popular art of its era in Japan. Their status in the West was elevated in part because of the influence of Japanese prints on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism]Impressionist[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionist[/url] painters. Through this reference, Lichtenstein reveals how easy it is to bridge between ‘high’ and ‘low’ art. Paintings like [i]Drowning girl[/i] continue this fusion by merging mainstream popular culture (cartoons and comic books) with high art."
Nurse,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,portrait,"Nurse, is a quintessential Lichtenstein heroine. His signature Ben-Day dots, her strong features and flawless skin mark her out as a striking woman. Her imposing uniform, the striped fabric of her dress, the stiff white collar and her starched white hat, clearly indicate that she is a member of the nursing profession. Yet her piercing blue eyes, bottle blond hair, and luscious red lips also lend the work a frisson of latent sexuality — less heavenly angel and more femme fatale."
Brushstroke,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,figurative,"[i]Brushstroke[/i] (1965) was the first painting of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/all-works#!#filterName:Series_brushstrokes,resultType:masonry][i]Brushstroke[/i] series[/url] created by American [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop[/url] artist Roy Lichtenstein between 1965 and 1966, and then continued in 1980s and 1990s. Although Lichtenstein abandoned the comic book motifs for which he was originally celebrated, he still drew inspiration from the aesthetic and the style of popular imagery. Comic books remain the chief influence of the [i]Brushstroke[/i] series. In fact, the initial source for [i]Brushstroke[/i] (1965) was a panel from the comic strip [i]The Painting[/i] from October 1964 edition of [i]Strange Suspense Stories[/i] published by Charlton Comics. This comic book drawn by Dick Giordano, tells the story of a tortured artist and a painting that seems to take on a life of its own.

From the early 1960s, Lichtenstein began to explore art as a theme by reinterpreting masterpieces of his predecessors, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/woman-with-flowered-hat-1963][i]Woman with Flowered Hat[/i][/url] (1963) based on [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/dora-maar-with-cat-1941][i]Dora Maar with Cat[/i][/url] (1941) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/non-objective-i-1964][i]Non-Objective I[/i][/url] (1964) inspired by the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url].  Lichtenstein revisits this theme in a different way in the [i]Brushstrokes[/i] series, this time focusing on the essence of painting, the painter’s brushstroke. The painting represents Lichtenstein’s commentary on the dominance of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionism[/url], an art movement developed in America post World War II. Specifically, it refers to the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Jackson Pollock[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/willem-de-kooning]Willem de Kooning[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-kline]Franz Kline[/url], who painted in a spontaneous manner using large brushes to make broad gestural strokes.  Brushstroke combines the rhythmical drips typical of Pollock and gestural sweeping brushstrokes of de Kooning. Lichtenstein also stated that he was greatly influenced by the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/dutch-golden-age]Dutch Golden Age[/url] painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frans-hals]Frans Hals[/url]. Hals, who was also admired by Abstract Expressionists, was known for his painterly style and loose and unblended brushstrokes.

In the painting, Lichtenstein enlarged the brushstroke and eliminated some of the details from the original illustration. The artist mimicked the graphic style of the comic book in the use of diagonal slashes, black outlines, and primary colors. He also manually painted Ben-Day dots that were used in the production of inexpensive publications. In this way, Lichtenstein continued to combine ‘low’ art and ‘high’ art, mass-produced commercial imagery, and traditional easel painting. In the painting, he interpreted the spontaneous brushstroke in a popular mass-produced style. The artist explained: “It’s taking something that originally was supposed to mean immediacy and I’m tediously drawing something that looks like a brushstroke… I want it to look as though it were painstaking. It’s a picture of a picture and it’s a misconstrued picture of a picture.” The painting has a satirical quality, the brushstroke, the painter’s spontaneous and personal gesture is depersonalized – it becomes a generic, mass-produced sign.

The brushstroke remained an important motif throughout Lichtenstein’s career. From the 1980s, he reinterpreted the motif to new forms: models, medium-sized and monumental sculptures. Some famous examples of these include public sculptures like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/brushstrokes-in-flight-1984][i]Brushstrokes in Flight[/i][/url] (1984) at the John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/brushstroke-1996][i]Brushstroke[/i][/url] (1996) at the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid, Spain, and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/tokyo-brushstrokes-i-and-ii-1994][i]Tokyo Brushwork I and II[/i][/url] (1994) at the Parrish Museum in Water Mill, New York."
Shipboard Girl,Lichtenstein Roy ,Pop Art,portrait,"Historical Description
Executed in yellow, red, blue and black, this work is composed of wonderful color dots that combine to create the image. Similarly to the way newspaper images are printed, Lichtenstein used sold outlines to frame the picture elements, and then filled them with these vibrant color dots. Recalling Seurat's pointillism technique, Lichtenstein relies on the instinct of our eye to fuse the separate dots into one overall color wash; however, Lichtenstein was a pop artist, and in his interest to play-with and titillate our eye, he makes the dots slightly too large, and slightly too far apart for us to fuse the dots together, thereby calling our attention to his technique. Further, Lichtenstein gives us fabulous subject matter in this ""incomplete narrative."" The incomplete narrative remained a popular style throughout Lichtenstein's career. In this sense, we are witness to an intriguing scene with a beautiful blonde (complete with bright red lips!) who is shown on the ship of a luxury liner (noted by the water and life-preserver). She has a curious expression, and because we are not given any other details into this mystery, we have an ""incomplete narrative."" From the visual construction to the artistic process, Lichtenstein provides us with a wealth of viewing enjoyment that engages our mind and our senses.

Created in 1965, this original color offset lithograph was published by Leo Castelli, NY, and printed by Graphic Industries, Inc., NY. This work is hand-signed by Roy Lichtenstein (New York, 1923 - New York, 1997) in pencil in the lower right and is from an unnumbered edition."
The Awakening of the forest,Delvaux Paul,Surrealism,mythological painting,"Paul Delvaux painted [i]The Awakening of the Forest[/i] in the late 1930’s, a time when the exposure to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealist[/url] art and ideas revolutionized his own ideas about painting. Delvaux was especially influenced by the early paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giorgio-de-chirico]Giorgio de Chirico[/url], whom Delvaux called ""The Poet of Emptiness."" He adopted Surrealism as a visual language that would help him bring to life his inner world filled with childhood memories and fantastical settings. [i]The Awakening of the Forest[/i], like a number of his other paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-delvaux/tribute-to-jules-verne-1971][i]Tribute to Jules Verne[/i][/url] (1971), was inspired by Delvaux's childhood fascination with the French novelist Jules Verne. Here, he depicts his interpretation of a scene from Verne’s [i]Journey to the Center of the Earth[/i] (1864), in which the protagonists (Professor Otto Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel) discover a prehistoric forest deep inside the Earth.

Delvaux paints professor Lidenbrock on the left side, examining a rock or a fossil, seemingly oblivious to the forest of naked female bodies that is displayed in front of him. The figure standing behind the professor, gazing away from the scene, is a self-portrait of the artist in the role of Axel. On both sides, there is a female figure in long Victorian dress holding an oil lamp, attempting in vain to shed light on the scene. The rich red pigment of these figures' dresses contrast with the forest’s’ dark green shades and the pale complexion of the naked skin of the nudes. The forest is illuminated by a full moon, and the naked figures seem at one with the forest. Some of them combine human and vegetal elements: sprouting leaves instead of hair, they seem to embody a primordial human state. The protagonists from the book seem out of place, and even intrusive next to the naked bodies. 

Regardless of the large number of naked figures and their detailed portrayal, [i]The Awakening of the Forest[/i] maintains a feeling of emotional detachment and general unawareness, that only adds to the eerie effect of the painting. There is a lack of communication between the figures: they seem more or less oblivious of one another. There is a sense of alienation, an overwhelming silence, that pierces through the canvas. Delvaux creates a world of suspended and unsatisfied desires, in which all but the oblivious professor, obsessed with his work, seem to express a melancholic awareness of the unimaginable distance between their desire and its consummation.

This painting possesses all the bizarre elements that ultimately make the main features of Delvaux's work: merging of opposing components, representation of the nudes, eerie light, and the sense of unease. This painting seems largely indebted to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-riou]Édouard Riou[/url], a French painter who illustrated six novels by Jules Verne. [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-riou/by-series/journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth]Riou’s illustrations[/url] of moonlit underground forests were tremendously influential on Delvaux’s formative years."
Pope Leo X (after Raphael),Botero Fernando,Naïve Art (Primitivism),portrait,"This painting was made in 1964, while Botero was still experimenting with what was soon to become his signature style. Called [i]boterismo[/i], it is characterized by highly stylized volumetric figures and objects, the flatness of surface and simplification of the color palette. As in this painting, Botero often painted portraits after famous works from an art history made by Old Masters - [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/leonardo-da-vinci]Da Vinci[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres]Ingres[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas]Degas[/url], etc. This type of artistic citation is quite common to the era of postmodernism. The style he uses in this painting could be easily characterized as naive or primitive on the basis of artistic manner, but in fact, the concept of his artworks is more postmodern then naive. The artist uses the legacy of pre-Columbian art as well as the tradition of Western painting, and creates a complex mixture of styles.  Also, the irony and caricature simplicity are often part of his artistic manner, by which he gives a critical comment on the society he lives in.

Oversized [i]Pope Leo X[/i], painted after [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael/portraits-of-leo-x-cardinal-luigi-de-rossi-and-giulio-de-medici-1518]Raphael’s portrait[/url], shows banality of copying older artworks, as well as the banality of our expectations from art and portrait paintings. Raphael’s work shows us a seriousness of the facial expression, a dedication to details, and a naturalism in the depiction of the character, while Botero’s painting shows none of these. Pope Leo X is represented oversimplified in form, grotesque in his size, in quite monochrome colors, and almost without any paraphernalia. Reducing the figure of the Pope to what it may be seen, in the 21st century, - as a figure that continues tradition without keeping the essence of it,- Botero humorously plays with the role of the Pope, as well as the role of artist, doomed to cite Old Masters. This is his personal reflection on the tradition of Western art, but also on the way a postmodern observer perceives past artworks."
Grand Maitre of the Outsider,Dubuffet Jean,Art Brut,figurative,"This pictures is typical of the Hautes Pates series that Dubuffet exhibited to huge controversy in 1946. A thick, monochromatic surface serves as the ground for the crudely depicted figure, which is a parody of portraiture. Although Dubuffet undoubtedly intended the series to offend, and his graphic style and thick, coarse impasto certainly did offend conventional tastes, it is worth noting that the color palette is not as jarring as it might be. Dubuffet was at least cautiously mindful of the need for success."
The Cow With The Subtle Nose,Dubuffet Jean,Art Brut,animal painting,"Dubuffet's heady experience in the country and rejection of art education is evident in this painting. The heavily textured surface depicts a cow, rendered in the child-like innocence of patients held in psychological facilities. The uninhibited, savage approach to the canvas exemplifies the concepts of what Dubuffet termed Art Brut - the image seems entirely unschooled in the traditions of landscape. The image is thus at odds with the notions of 'high art', and approaches art making from the direction of artistic purity uninfluenced by cultural advancement. Going a step further, Dubuffet suggests how 'cultural' and the 'savage' approaches to art together work to reaffirm civilization as a whole."
Soul of the Underground,Dubuffet Jean,Tachisme,abstract,"Soul of the Underground exemplifies Dubuffet's fascination with texture and his departure from representational painting. Inspired by the surface quality of Jean Fautrier's paintings, Dubuffet's use of aluminum foil and oil paint creates a coarse, uneven surface resembling mineral deposits. Here Dubuffet completely abandons pictorial representation in order to evoke sheer matter, sheer unprocessed material. It is part of a series of Texturologies that he worked on throughout the 1950s as he became more interested in evoking different sorts of texture. 

After the horrible destruction of World War II, mud and dirt is what remained in plentitude. Rather than proclaiming that civilization had ceased, Dubuffet wanted to use the rubble to build anew, and to purify for the future. In addition, the dirt is thought of as a material that has a natural structure that can be discovered, explored, and put to new uses."
l'Hourloupe,Dubuffet Jean,Art Brut,abstract,"Dubuffet's L'Hourloupe series began in 1962 and would preoccupy the artist for many decades. The inspiration came from a doodle he created while on the telephone, and the fluid movement of the line combines with limited fields of color to create movement. He believed the style evoked the manner in which objects appear in the mind. This contrast between physical and mental representation later encouraged him to use the approach to create sculpture."
Monument with Standing Beast,Dubuffet Jean,Art Brut,sculpture,"Monument with Standing Beast is a sculpture based on Dubuffet's Hourloupe series. The piece is one of his three monumental sculptures based in the United States. The sculpture is an abstract representation of a tree, a standing animal, and an architectural structure. The work evokes graffiti and cartoons, though it also plays on the contrast between mental images and real objects. The visitor is invited to wander and contemplate within the black and white walls of the sculpture."
Standing Open Structure Black,LeWitt Sol,Minimalism,sculpture,"Derived from the spare, iconic forms that began with such paintings as Wall Structure Blue, this work stands as their most elemental component. Although the shape is abstract, the relatable, human-like proportions (it stands 96 inches high) recall a skeleton, with all of its solemn dignity and shock value. As one of the first open structures, Standing Open Structure Black can be seen as the standard building block for much of LeWitt's later work. As with his Minimalist painting, LeWitt's simplified sculptures of this period challenge the notion of completeness and suggest that any additions to the basic elements of a work of art are excessive."
Serial Project (Set B),LeWitt Sol,"Conceptual Art, Minimalism",sculpture,"This accumulation of open structures signifies a revival of seriality in LeWitt's work, inspired by the serial photographs of Eadweard Muybridge, whose work LeWitt discovered in an abandoned book a previous tenant had left in his apartment. The network of cubes allowed LeWitt to study the juxtaposition of different sizes and shapes, arranged according to certain preset rules and ideas. Looking at Serial Project #1 as a whole, it appears to be nothing so much as a city, revealing LeWitt's architectural roots. It also imposes itself as a kind of framework for a finished work or series of works, imitating the preparatory sketches that precede blueprints and completed structures. Once again, LeWitt challenges the conventional methods of artistic production; in this instance, he halts the additive process of sculpting and allows the viewer to observe what would only have existed beneath other materials."
Buried Cube Containing an Object of Importance but Little Value,LeWitt Sol,Conceptual Art,photo,"The burial of the cube reportedly took place in a local garden, but these photographs, referring again to the notion of the series or process, are the only proof that LeWitt's actions actually took place. Without seeing the event taking place, or knowing what is held within the cube, Buried Cube relies on the idea, as opposed to a finished object. A conceptual piece, this work was produced shortly following the publication of LeWitt's 1968 manifesto describing the new Conceptual art movement. In the manifesto, he declares, ""The execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art."" Likewise, by emptying this ""burial""-like an actual interment, an extremely important, emotional, and personal affair-of content, value, gesture and expression, LeWitt disengages himself from the work and takes a strong ""death of the author"" stance. In his own words: ""Once it is out of his hand the artist has no control over the way a viewer will perceive the work. Different people will understand the same thing in a different way."""
Lines in Four Directions in Flowers,LeWitt Sol,Conceptual Art,installation,"In 1981, leading conceptual artist Sol LeWitt was invited by the Fairmount Park Art Association (currently known as the Association for Public Art) to propose a public artwork for a site in Fairmount Park. He selected the long, rectangular plot of land known as the Reilly Memorial and submitted a drawing with instructions. Installed thirty years after its conception, Lines in Four Directions in Flowers is a work of monumental scale, made up of more than 7,000 plantings arranged in strategically configured rows. In his original proposal, the artist describes an installation of flower plantings of ""four different colors (white, yellow, red & blue) in four equal rectangular areas, in rows of four directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal right & left) framed by evergreen hedges of about 2’ height. In the winter the rows of plants would retain their linear direction, in the summer the flowers would bloom and provide the color."""
Architect's Home in the Ravine,Doig Peter,Magic Realism,landscape,"Plainly in view but physically inaccessible, Peter Doig half obliterates The Architect’s Home in the Ravine with an underbrush as dense as a half-finished Pollock and the scene becomes foreboding: something out of an Edward Hopper or an Andrew Wyeth painting. With all the richness of the distant woods and the stunning architecture to look at, it’s the twigs which steal the show. Peter Doig’s painting reinvents the way a picture is meant to be looked at."
Untitled B,Sherman Cindy,Feminist Art,photo,"Untitled A, B, C and D belong to a more extensive series of photographs Sherman made while she was studying art at the State University College at Buffalo, New York (1972-6). She selected five images from the series and arbitrarily labelled them A to E. They were enlarged and reprinted in editions of ten. Tate’s copies are the first prints in each edition."
Untitled,Sherman Cindy,Feminist Art,photo,"Bus Riders is a series of fifteen black and white photographs Sherman produced shortly after graduating from the State University College at Buffalo, New York, where she studied art (1972-6). They were not publically exhibited until the artist had them reprinted in late 2000 for an exhibition at Glen Horowitz Booksellers at East Hampton, New York, together with another series from the same period, Murder Mystery People (1976/2000). Both series were reprinted in editions of twenty. Bus Riders and Murder Mystery People provide an important bridge between a series Sherman created as a student, Untitled A, B, C and D 1975, and her first major work, the Untitled Film Stills 1977-80). Like these other early series, Bus Riders may be seen as an exploration of portraiture and the mechanics of its staging."
Untitled Film Still #15,Sherman Cindy,Feminist Art,photo,"When the Museum of Modern Art announced in 1996 that it had just acquired Sherman's complete Untitled Film Still series, the curators knew they had laid claim to one of the most representative works of the early 1980s American movement of ""appropriation,"" and ""simulationism."" Both terms refer to American artists' mimicking, in the first half of the 1980s, former art masterpieces or widely circulating images in the mass media, and critically reworking them to arouse a sense of unease in the viewer, indeed often suggesting that culture had become largely a game of theatrical posing and egoistic pretense. As Peter Galassi, then-curator of photography stated, ""Sherman's singular talent and sensibility crystallized broadly held concerns in the culture as a whole, about the role of mass media in our lives, and about the ways in which we shape our personal identities. Here, Sherman takes on the role of the small-town girl just happening upon the Big City. She is, typically, at first suspicious of the metropolitan lights and shadows, only to be eventually seduced by its undeniable attractions."
Untitled Film Still #53,Sherman Cindy,Feminist Art,photo,"Untitled Film Stills is a series of sixty-nine black-and-white photographs made between 1977 and 1980. In them Sherman appears as fictitious characters in scenarios resembling moments in a film. She used vintage clothing, wigs and makeup to create a range of female personae which she then photographed in apparently solitary, unguarded moments of reflection, undress, or in conversation with somebody off-set and outside of the frame. The ‘stills’ are set in a variety of interior locations as well as outside in urban and rural landscapes. They were begun shortly after Sherman moved to New York city with the artist Robert Longo (born 1953)."
Untitled #97,Sherman Cindy,Feminist Art,photo,"Sherman’s photographs Untitled #97, 98, 99 and 100 are collectively known as her ‘Pink Robes’ series. They feature a pink chenille bathrobe, the only prop used in this series apart from a white face towel, and the edge or corner of a chair, in #100. In the first three images Sherman holds the robe to her body, covering herself with it; in the last image she wears it. The photographs were shot close-up so that the artist entirely fills the frame. They are slightly larger than life size. The images become progressively darker through the series; in all of them the background is too dark to be visible. Sherman has explained: ‘I was thinking of the idea of the centerfold model. The pictures were meant to look like a model just after she’d been photographed for a centerfold. They aren’t cropped, and I thought that I wouldn’t bother with make-up and wigs and just change the lighting and experiment while using the same means in each.’"
Untitled #126,Sherman Cindy,Feminist Art,photo,"Untitled #126 is a colour photograph in which the artist appears, costumed and made up, posing with one foot up on a cane chair. It belongs to one of four groups of photographs relating to fashion photography that Sherman produced between 1983 and 1994. The first group, into which Untitled #126 falls, was commissioned by American retail entrepreneur Diane Benson for a spread in Interview magazine. She supplied Sherman with clothes by such top-of-the-range international designers as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Comme des Garçons. In the same year the French fashion house Dorothée Bis offered their own clothes for a series to appear in French Vogue. The images Sherman created for these two ‘fashion shoots’ are the antithesis of the glamorous world of fashion. The model in the photographs appears silly, angry, dejected, exhausted, abused, scarred, grimy and psychologically disturbed."
Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn,Weiwei Ai,Conceptual Art,performance,"Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn is a photographic artwork created by Ai Weiwei in 1995. Composed of three 148 by 121 cm black-and-white photographs, it documents Ai holding, dropping, and standing over the remains of a Han dynasty urn that was approximately 2,000 years old."

Rabbit,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"Rabbit is a 1986 series of three identical stainless steel sculptures by Jeff Koons. One of the editions of Rabbit is the most expensive work sold by a living artist at auction, being sold for $91.1 million in May 2019."
Fait d’Hiver,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"Fait d'Hiver depicts a woman lying on her back in the snow. The upper torso and head of the woman are featured in the sculpture, her breasts exposed beneath a sparsely-knitted dress. A pig and two penguins stand near to her head, adding the kitsch element that is thematic throughout the collection. The catalogue colourfully described the work as a ""Walt Disney version of an erotic fantasy ... juxtaposing a strong sexual element with the saccharine sweetness of decorative knicknacks"". It went on to say that the ""disturbing combination identifies a primal hunger at the heart of American consumerism"".[10]

Koons based the design of the woman on a photograph of porn actress Ilona Staller that featured in Stern.[10] He had not met Staller at the time but went on to have a very public relationship with her, using her as a muse for many subsequent works.[3]

In November 2001 an edition of the sculpture was auctioned by Phillips de Pury & Company with an estimate of up to US$2.5 million but it failed to sell.[10] Several years later, on November 13, 2007, Christie's auctioned the artist's proof with a final sale price of US$4.3 million.[11][12] In 2018 a French court found that Koons' sculpture had plagiarised a 1985 advertisement for Naf Naf [fr], a women's clothing retailer. Damages and costs were awarded against Koons but the sculpture was not seized.[13][14]"
Ushering in Banality,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"A pig with a green ribbon is being pushed by two young angels (alongside it) with a young boy dressed in a tracksuit behind it.[27] Ushering in Banality was ruled to have ""deliberately and exactly copied"" a photograph by Barbara Campbell. Koons had instructed his Italian studio to replicate Campbell's Boys with Pig using it as a model for the design.[6]

At a Sotheby's auction in November 2001 one of the three editions of Ushering in Banality sold for US$1,875,750.[31]"
St. John the Baptist,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's painting, St. John the Baptist, Koons' sculpture was made in the same pose but he also added a pig and a bird into the saint's arms. His outstretched arm points to a cross.[27][28] It has been described as ""an insouciant yet sinister conflation of the sacred and the profane"".[29]

One edition of the sculpture was set to go on show at the Wright Exhibition Space in Seattle in February 2004, but it was discovered to have a sizeable crack along the arm. Bought in 1991 for US$150,000, the damage is expected to have reduced the resale price of the piece, though none of the editions have been sold at auction since. Patricia Leavengood, a sculpture conservation specialist, partly restored the damage and reduced the visibility of the crack. She noted, however, that ""When it cracked, part of it slid forward and can't be moved back into place ... Porcelain wasn't meant to exist at this size. My primary task is to stabilize the piece, and that I can do.""[29]"
String of Puppies,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"String of Puppies is a porcelain sculpture depicting a man and a woman sat on a bench holding eight blue puppies. The inspiration came from a photograph by Art Rogers entitled Puppies. Koons found the picture on a postcard and, when he gave it to his assistants with instructions on how to model the sculpture, he asked that as much detail be copied as possible. He requested a few changes to the original, asking for the puppies to be blue with exaggerated noses, and for flowers to be added to the hair of the man and woman. The three editions of the sculpture were sold for a total of $367,000.[5][6][30]

Upon discovering that his picture had been copied, Rogers sued Koons and the Sonnabend Gallery for copyright infringement. Koons admitted to having copied the image intentionally and, in 1992, the court found ""substantial similarity"" between the two works and that Koons acted in a ""willful and egregious"" manner. They rejected his parody argument and awarded a significant settlement to Rogers.[5][30]"
Wild Boy and Puppy,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"Wild Boy and Puppy is a porcelain sculpture featuring a yellow cartoon dog, a ""wild boy"" with red spiky hair, and a bumblebee in a basket. The cartoon dog is a clear replica of Odie from the Garfield comic strip by Jim Davis with only minimal changes. In 1993, United Feature Syndicate, Inc. sued Koons for his unsanctioned use of Odie, successfully arguing that he had breached copyright law. Koons had defended himself in other cases using the parody argument but could not do so here—he testified to being unaware of the source of the character and therefore could not have directed the parody at the comic.[7][32]

One edition of the sculpture sold in November 2004 for US$1.5 million, significantly higher than its US$400,000 estimate.[33]"
Pink Panther,Koons Jeff,"Neo-Pop Art, Conceptual Art",sculpture,"Pink Panther is a 41-inch tall porcelain sculpture featuring Jayne Mansfield holding the cartoon character Pink Panther. Mansfield is sculpted from the waist up and is partly clothed, her breasts being exposed;[21] her right hand covers her nearly-exposed breast. The Pink Panther is shown in full, his chin over the left shoulder of Mansfield. Robert Storr, curator of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, commented on the piece: ""His mating of Jayne Mansfield and the eponymous cartoon character in Pink Panther is a thoroughly enjoyable send-up of heterosexual rapture and celebrity romance.""[22] Koons' himself states that the piece was intended to represent the Pink Panther as a female masturbation aid. His depiction of the character caused legal issues and Koons was sued for copyright infringement, eventually settling out of court.[23]"
Bear and Policeman,Koons Jeff,"Neo-Pop Art, Conceptual Art",sculpture,"A smiling brown bear wearing a striped T-shirt has his arm around a shorter policeman who is looking up at the animal.

""The relatively diminutive constable, a symbol of authority, contrasts comically with the bear's monstrous size and relative harmlessness. Looking helplessly up at the bear, the expression on the policeman's face holds the key to enjoying Koons' work: a temporary suspension of adulthood, a return to seeing the world through a child's perspective. Koons seems to hint that the adult world, with its explicit content, greed and shame, is worth staving off.""

Monkeys (Chair),Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,"sculpture, installation","The sculpture is a somewhat surreal combination of everyday objects. Three monkeys, which resemble very much inflatable children's toys, are connected together. They form a chain that dangles from the ceiling. A white straw chair is attached at the lowest end of the chain. The sculpture illustrates Jeff Koon's fascination for children's toys which becomes particularly evident in the Popeye Series for which Koons sought inspiration in floating aids in the shape of animals.[2] The monkeys that feature in the sculpture remind of the game Barrel of Monkeys in which the players have to gain the hook-tailed monkeys in a chain. Monkeys (Chair) is an example of Koons's strategy of mashing up ideas and methods of Pop, Conceptual, and appropriation art with handicraft and popular culture.[3]

The monkey figures are made of polychromed aluminium. Real plastic toys served as a template for the execution of this work of art. The shiny surface of the metal helps creating a perfect illusion. The transfer into another material creates new static conditions which allow the attachment of the chair at the lowest end of the chain.

In this work Jeff Koons plays with different material perceptions. The monkeys seem to be made of plastic, but this impression contradicts the sculpture's static properties. If the chain of monkeys was made of inflatable toys, it could not support the heavy weight of the chair. The spectator's only possibility to resolve this contradictory perception is to take a look at the artwork's label."

Play-Doh,Koons Jeff,Neo-Pop Art,sculpture,"The title refers to the modeling compound named Play-Doh which is used for arts and crafts projects by young children.

In reference to the sculpture Play-Doh Koons has said that he tries to ""make objects that you can't make any judgements about"". In the same commentary Koons said ""If you take Play-Doh apart... they're organic shapes that all stack on top of each other... so that these surfaces are meeting on the inside and you never see that... the public doesn't see it but I think that you feel it and it has kind of a Freudian quality to it. I really thought that Play-Doh captures the twentieth century and you have this aspect of Freud with this mound of Play-Doh and the way the organic shapes are on top of each other... and within art you have this abstract expressionism... you have this aspect of DeKooning or something...""[2]

Koons explains in Highsnobiety, in a video associated with Christie's, that he originally conceived ""Play-Doh"" to be a polyethylene sculpture. Koons eventually felt that he could not get the undercuts that he wanted using polyethylene. Koons was unwilling to compromise on the superrealism that he aimed for and opted instead for aluminum. Koons wanted the sculpture to be believable as a mound of Play-Doh. Koons was concerned in the sculpture's development that angles not be too sharp and organic forms not be too organic. This was with the aim of reproducing the appearance of the ""Play-Doh"" modeling compound on which the sculpture is based.[3]"
Mouth (Brigitte Bardot's Lips),Richter Gerhard,Pop Art,figurative,"[i]Mouth (Bridgette Bardot’s Lips)[/i] (1963) is an early painting by Gerhard Richter based on an image of the famous French actress Bridgette Bardot. Richter cropped the image, isolating her lips and mouth. The choice of Bardot was not coincidental: at the time, she was one of the most prominent sex symbols from Europe. Her public image exemplified the connection between sex and mass culture, specifically the commodification of sex in capitalist societies. Thus, by isolating Bardot’s famous sensual lips in [i]Mouth[/i], Richter created an image that is both playful and disturbing. The painting also has a surrealist quality: the blurred lips and mouth are dismembered and detached from the face and body. A few years later, Richter also used another image of Bardot in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/mother-and-daughter-b-1965][i]Mother and Daughter[/i][/url] (1965). Bardot’s appeal was not only limited to Richter’s works, but her iconic image was also captured by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url] in eight [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol/brigitte-bardot-1974]colorful paintings[/url] created in 1974.

[i]Mouth[/i] and [i]Mother and Daughter[/i] were examples of Richter’s early photo-paintings, whose sources were photographs collected by the artist. In 1962, Richter began collecting snapshots, postcards, newspaper cutting, and sketches. A few years later, Richter began to arrange the different images on loose sheets of paper, and at present, there are over 800 sheets. Over time, the collection became an art project in its own right called [i]Atlas[/i], which mixed collected images with personal photographs, and photographs taken by Richter himself. The collection offers significant insight into Richter’s artistic practice, and also reflects the different phases in his life.

[i]Mouth[/i] was featured in one of Richter’s first public exhibitions, [i]Living with Pop: A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism[/i] in Düsseldorf. The 1963 exhibition was a performance event staged in a furniture shop, where the artists exhibited their paintings in the shop setting. The exhibition was conceived and organized by Richter and his contemporaries, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/manfred-kuttner]Manfred Kuttner[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/konrad-lueg]Konrad Lueg[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke]Sigmar Polke[/url], that used the term ‘[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/capitalist-realism]Capitalist Realism[/url]’ to describe their art. Capitalist Realism is at times thought of as German [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] because of its shared characteristics with Pop Art, namely the interest in mass media, consumerism, and the banality of daily life. Through humor and irony, the artists expressed their unique political situation of living in a divided Germany during the Cold War. The name, Capitalist Realism, served as a parallel to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/socialist-realism]Socialist Realism[/url] (the dominant style in the Eastern German bloc) since both were essentially art forms created for the masses. 

By late 1963, Richter no longer distorted his source photographs in the extreme manner visible in [i]Mouth[/i]. He even destroyed several of his earlier paintings executed in this style. Perhaps, Richter would have also destroyed [i]Mouth[/i], but he already gave it to his fellow artist, Manfred Kuttner. In a 1993 interview, Richter expressed dislike for the painting, specifically its Pop Art style and the isolation and deformation of the face and mouth. However, he also stated that the painting was a representative example of his early work and the beginning of Pop Art."
Colour Streaks,Richter Gerhard,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In this example of one of his early grey paintings, Richter allows structure and color to compose the ""picture."" The painting is void of figuration and recognizable imagery, revealing Richter's indifference toward any ""model"" as serving as his subject matter. Richter employs thick brushstrokes and monochromatic color, thus sweeping across the canvas in a fluid, entirely fused motion. This powerful gesture suggests a consideration of how abstract forms may well serve as a painter's subject just as effectively, for their visual or optical interest, as any photographic or ""realistic"" scene derived from nature, or the ""everyday world"" around us."
1024 Colours,Richter Gerhard,"Conceptual Art, Op Art",abstract,"[i]1024 colors[/i] (1973) is one of Richter’s well-known color chart paintings, which he began producing in the late 1960s. They were inspired by the commercial color charts found in hardware stores. Here, the different colors have no particular meaning or significance. He used color functions as a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintingadvancedsearch#!#filter:advanced,minYear:-50000,maxYear:2020,dictionaries:57726bcdedc2cb3880ae735e]readymade[/url], as an object found in the hardware store and another part of consumer culture. Even though the painting mimics a commercial color chart, the colors are not grouped in the same order. Instead, the painting was created through a predetermined mathematical system, and the colors were distributed at random across the grid. The white lines that form the grid are equally spaced, and each color occupies equal space within the painting. This kind of distribution points to indifference and meaninglessness: it is part of the artist’s premise that it is impossible to combine colors in a meaningful way.

Although Richter, at the time, was unfamiliar with the works of American artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly]Ellsworth Kelly[/url], there are stylistic similarities between his color chart paintings and Kelly’s work. Kelly’s collages, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly/spectrum-colors-arranged-by-chance-vi-1951][i]Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance VI[/i][/url] (1951) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly/spectrum-colors-arranged-by-chance-ii-1951][i]Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance II[/i][/url] (1951), were similar in both style and method. Like Richter, who used a mathematical system to arrange his colors, Kelly cut up his small squares and arranged them quickly and intuitively. Both artists worked within a system but found random methods that determined their creations. The earliest versions of Richter's color chart paintings were relatively simple, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/ten-colours-1966][i]Ten Colors[/i][/url] (1966) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/color-chart-no-139-1-1966][i]Color Chart[/i][/url] (1966). By the 1970s, Richter developed the concept and created more massive and more complex color chart paintings and prints, among them [i]1024 colors[/i].

Richter’s color chart paintings were born out of a creative standstill the artist experienced during the late 1960s. Richter felt he could no longer paint figurative paintings based on photographic images, which dominated his bodywork from 1961 to 1966. Because the artist found that he was drained of ideas for his figurative paintings, he began creating imageless paintings. In this way, Richter rejected his prior work while continuing to create new artworks - his color chart paintings, reflecting his feelings of emptiness and his disenchantment with his earlier works. At the same time, it opened Richter to the exploration of pure color and form. Richter introduced abstraction to his paintings, while still following his primary method and artistic principal. He believed that the plight of the modern artist was his inability to create new paintings without relying on other pre-arranged structures.

For this reason, Richter used photographs as sources for his 1960s figurative paintings. Similarly, when he moved to color chart painting, he created another system with an infinite pool of available combinations for his paintings. Richter’s color chart paintings proved essential and consequential for his later works.  The artist used the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/4096-colours-1974][i]4096 colors[/i][/url] (1974) as a base for one of his most substantial commissions, the stained glass [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/cologne-cathedral-window-2007][i]Cologne Cathedral Window[/i][/url] (2007), which replaced the window destroyed during World War II."
Abstract Painting,Richter Gerhard,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In 1976, Richter first employed the term ""Abstract Painting"" as a formal title for many of his works, such as this example. Cool tones of purple and blue create a hazy, shallow atmospheric perspective. The composition is structured with geometric shapes and lines that might at first appear as fractured icebergs emerging from the painted surface, only to settle down, as it were, into pure abstraction. Richter did not want to offer a definitive explanation for his abstract work, stating only that he was ""letting a thing come, rather than creating it."" Standing in relation to such work, a viewer begins to question whether what he/she perceives is fact or fiction, the real or the artificial, as though slowly being trained in a new school of visual philosophy."
Clouds,Richter Gerhard,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"Clouds is an example of how Richter frequently alternates between realist and abstract styles in various series of work, as well as on a single canvas. In this instance, even the title bears an ambiguous relation to the entire composition. In the lower region of the canvas, for instance, Richter suggests that the viewer is having a perceptual experience of looking through a window; nevertheless, the bold tracks, scrapes, smudges, and layerings of paint above playfully cancel that optical illusion. Thus Richter is frequently fascinated by how a viewer's desire to extract ""meaning"" from a given work of art often proves utterly futile. He suggests that we might instead relish a simple experience of visual pleasure, or the discovery of ""beauty"" by way of studying abstract forms for their own sake."
Ölberg,Richter Gerhard,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"[i]Oelberg[/i] (1986) represents Richter’s mature abstract style. The most significant innovation in his 1980s abstract paintings was the use of a plastic spatula as an additional tool for applying paint and achieving special painterly effects. Richter’s spatulas varied in size; the largest was three meters in length and could imitate the effects of large paintbrushes. He also used other tools, like squeegees, palette knives, wooden utensils, and different types of brushes.

To understand the evolvement of Richter’s abstract style, we need to understand the process of creation of paintings like [i]Oelberg[/i]. The artist developed such paintings through multiple layers of paint. Throughout the 1980s, Richter worked on integrating these layers into compelling artwork. At first, Richter stretched the large canvas on the floor applied diluted paint in tones of yellow, orange, red, green, and blue. This initial layer served as a base for working with the spatula. Many times this layer had geometric shapes that became obscured in the final painting. Richter often left some of the under-layers visible, usually on the edges of the canvas. In Oelberg, the under-layer is seen in the blue rectangle in the upper left corner of the canvas, and in the yellow, pink, and green along the lower edge of the painting. In the following phase, Richter would mount the painting on the wall and then work on the second layer with the help of the spatula. The top layers were applied with the spatula, starting from the top and moving downward to imitate the effect of broad downward brushstrokes. Richter worked with the edge of the spatula, adjusting and changing the pressure to control the density of the color and create diverse painterly effects. For instance, the slow pulling of the thick paint produced the broad lines of paint that stretch-out over the surface. Finally,  to complete the last details on [i]Oelberg[/i], Richter most likely worked with large brushes.

The title of the painting, [i]Oelberg[/i], has multiple layers of meaning. On a personal level, it relates to the name of the street in which the grandparents of Richter’s former wife, the artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/isa-genzken]Isa Genzken[/url], reside (Richter and Genzken were together between 1982 and 1993). Oelberg is also the name of the highest hill in the Sieben Mountain range southeast of Bonn. Additionally, it was the original name of the Mount of Olives in the New Testament. Like the multi-layered painting, the title can be associated with Richter’s personal life, a natural setting, and a Biblical reference. As the title suggests, the viewer can find some elements of a landscape in the abstract vision of Oelberg.

Similarly, Richter often created a blur effect in his photo-paintings, as in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/child-on-a-horse-1965][i]Child on a Horse[/i][/url] (1965), that gave the image an abstract quality. It reflected the tension between the figurative and the abstract in Richter’s paintings. Richter continued to produce elaborate abstract paintings like [i]Oelberg[/i] until 1988, at which point he once again turned his attention to figurative painting, creating the series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/all-works#!#filterName:Series_18-oktober-1977-1988,resultType:masonry][i]18 Oktober 1977[/i][/url]."
Man Shot Down No.669 1,Richter Gerhard,New European Painting,figurative,"[i]Man Shot Down I[/i] is one of fifteen canvases that belong to the series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/all-works#!#filterName:Series_18-oktober-1977-1988,resultType:masonry][i]18. Oktober 1977.[/i][/url] The series depicts the terrorist group Baader-Meinhof and the traumatic events of the [i]German Autumn[/i] (events in Germany in late 1977 associated with actions of terrorists from Red Army Faction and further police persecution of adherents of left ideology). The Baader-Meinhof committed numerous crimes, including murder and kidnapping, that resulted in the imprisonment and conviction of the group’s leadership. In an attempt to negotiate their release, other members kidnapped the businessman and industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer and hijacked a Lufthansa plane in Somalia. On the night of October 17, 1977, the state ran a successful operation and was able to recover control of the hijacked plane. The next morning, three of the convicted leaders were found dead in their cells, and the fourth was injured with multiple stab wounds. Even though the official reports concluded it was suicide, many speculated that the prisoners were murdered. After the press had announced their deaths, Schleyer was executed by his kidnappers.

In developing the concept for the series, Richter began with collecting images related to the event, photographs released by the police, and pictures published in the German press. These were the basis for all the paintings in the series. [i]Man Shot Down I[/i] shows the image of Andreas Baader, co-founder of the Baader-Meinhof, who was found shot in the head in his cell. Richter used the gaze of the camera as a starting point and created a ‘blur effect’ with layers of gray, that obscured many of the details. Art critics have linked Baader’s posture in [i]Man Shot Down I[/i] to historical artworks, which portray the dead body, such as depictions of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/Search/Pieta][i]Pieta[/i][/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david]Jacques Louis David[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-death-of-marat-1793][i]The Death of Marat[/i][/url] (1793). 

Although Richter selected a controversial political moment in contemporary history, he did not intend to make a political statement in his paintings. Richter’s painterly treatment creates a sense of elusiveness: it is a way to amplify the distance from the actual events and show that there are no answers available. The series deals with broad themes of death, suffering, and grief. Richter recognized the complexity of the situation: the horrible crimes committed by the terrorists, the institutional failures that led to the radicalization of these young people, and their deaths, which were a gruesome event in itself. By addressing the events ten years after the fact, Richter touches upon concepts of collective memory, and the public’s ability to recollect or repress events from contemporary history.

Richter wished to keep the series in one place, and to present it to the public as a whole. In 1995, the entire series was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York. The acquisition caused considerable controversy, as many felt that the paintings were nationally significant and should remain in Germany. Richter’s series dealt with an event deeply entrenched in the collective memory of the people of West Germany, and some questioned the effectiveness of the series on non-German audiences. For Richter, however, this was an opportunity to distance the paintings from the local political debate. By opening the series to new audiences, there was a possibility to transform the paintings into non-specific artworks that addressed universal themes of human suffering and mourning."
Youth Portrait (October 18),Richter Gerhard,New European Painting,portrait,"This portrait depicts Ulrike Meinhof as a young, politically active journalist before becoming one of the main protagonists of the left-wing terrorist group Red Army Faction (RAF).

Like all paintings of Richter’s cycle [i]October 18, 1977[/i], [i]Youth Portrait[/i] corresponds to a photographic source image that Richter found in press archives in Hamburg in the magazine [i]stern[/i], copied and eventually transferred onto the canvas. Only four years later, on 14th May 1970 Meinhof took part in the forcible rescue of Andreas Baader from prison – commonly seen as the beginning of the RAF.

 In adapting the photograph, the artist has made some changes: Ulrike Meinhof seems to be much younger, her gaze seems decidedly less determined and her mouth is set less vigorously then on the source image. By blurring the still wet paint Richter heightens the youthful and delicate appearance of the portrait. Meinhof’s gaze emits an almost melancholic reflectiveness (Richter himself called the painting “sentimental in a bourgeois way“) and the painting’s title underlines Richter’s intention of showing Meinhof as a young woman that seems to be inexperienced, unsuspecting and almost childlike. The composition and the arrangement of the portrait in front of a dark background are remindful of portraits of actors or paintings in the way of old masters and focus the attention on Meinhof herself.

[i]Youth Portrait[/i] contrasts strongly with the rest of the cycle that broaches the issue of the death of the RAF leaders. It is a comparatively small painting that by way of Meinhof’s direct gaze evokes an almost intimate relationship with the viewer, intensified by the fact that many people might own a similar portrait of themselves. The image of one of the leader of the terrorists, effectively created and influenced by the media, is thus put into perspective and contradicted by the apparent harmlessness of the portrait. Richter’s [i]Youth Portrait[/i] also evokes thoughts about the time that has passed between the shot of the photograph and the paintings that show Ulrike Meinhof after her suicide as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/dead-1988][i]Dead[/i][/url] (1988) and contrasts them with a “pure” vision of the past.

Ulrike Meinhof thus appears as a person and not as a character contorted by the media that is alternatively demonized or mystified but always dehumanised. Her portrait invites the viewer to identify with her on a personal level and hints that every person is capable of possibly committing similar crimes.

From [url href=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/art/paintings/photo-paintings/baader-meinhof-56/youth-portrait-7697/?p=1&sp=32]www.gerhard-richter.com[/url]"
Abstract Picture,Richter Gerhard,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In a series of completely abstract works of the early 1990s, Richter challenges the eye of the viewer to detect anything in the field of vision other than the pure elements of his art: color, gesture, the layering of pasty materials, and the artist's impersonal raking of these concoctions in various ways that allow chance combinations to emerge from the surface. Richter suggests only a shallow space akin to that of a mirror. The viewer is finally coaxed to set aside all searches for ""content"" that might originate from outside these narrow parameters and find satisfaction in the object's beauty in and of itself, as though one were relishing a fine textile. One thus appreciates the numerous colors and transitions that occur in this painting, many having been created outside the complete control of the artist much as nature often creates wondrous optical pleasures partly by design, and partly by accident."
Moritz,Richter Gerhard,New European Painting,figurative,"Ostensibly a painting of his young son, Mortiz exemplifies Richter's affinity for striking a tense balance between abstraction and figuration. This painting is a hybrid, seemingly fluctuating between two contrasting, unfinished areas, one section realistically rendered (in part harking back to Richter's Social Realist education), the other fading off into ethereal ""white noise."" Mortiz is reminiscent of Andy Warhol's combination of appropriated imagery and painted silkscreen techniques; a hazy glow seemingly emanates from the young boy, thus providing a powerful contrast to the material reality of the painted surface."
September,Richter Gerhard,New European Painting,figurative,"Richter painted [i]September[/i] (2005)  in response to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. On that day, Richter was flying to New York; his flight was diverted to another airport after the news of the attacks. In a small way, Richter felt the impact of the historical tragedy as it happened. It was not the first time Richter took on such a complex and politically charged subject. Most notably, his series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/gerhard-richter/all-works#!#filterName:Series_18-oktober-1977-1988,resultType:masonry][i]18 Oktober 1977[/i][/url], deals with the deaths of the leaders of the German home-grown terrorist group, Baader-Meinhof.

[i]September[/i] is one of Richter’s photo-paintings based on photographs. Richter began collecting photos in the early 1960s and used them as a basis for his work. Throughout the years, the collection developed into an archive that the artist named [i]Atlas[/i]. At present, it contains over 800 sheets of paper with different images that piqued the artist’s interest. [i]Atlas[/i] includes several photographs of terrorist attacks, which is indicative of Richter’s artistic process: he recognizes his subject through [i]Atlas[/i], selects an image, and then executes the painting. For [i]September[/i], he chose the dramatic moment of the second plane hitting one of the Twin Towers, the action that set in motion the collapse of the World Trade Center. Richter first painted the entire scene and then scraped the surface, exposing the white dots on the canvas. Through this process, the initially bright colors became muddled: mixing bright blues and oranges resulted in shades of grey and brown that dominate the canvas. Richter created the effect of a dissolving image that mirrors the depicted scene of the dissolving of the towers. In this way, the painting also engages the viewer’s memory; the familiar image is obscured, forcing the viewer to recollect and reexamine their memory of the event.

Like in [i]18 Oktober 1977[/i], Richter continues to deal with the topic of terrorism. Even though Richter selects politically charged issues, he attempts to highlight the ambiguities, the inexplicable elements of the event. The sense of ambiguity relates to how collective memory functions, but it also points to how Richter as an artist, wishes to present these tragic occurrences. By blurring the image, his paintings do not provide answers. Instead, they emphasize everything that remains unknown. By choosing subjects that relate to contemporary history, Richter also engages with the artistic tradition of historical paintings. Generally speaking, historical paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937][i]Guernica[/i][/url] (1937) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david]Jacques Louis David[/url]’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/the-oath-of-horatii-1784][i]The Oath of Horatii[/i][/url] (1784), are grand in scale and monumental in their depictions. The relatively small format of [i]September[/i] (52x72cm) does not suit the grand, heroic historical painting. The size relates to how this event was processed around the world. It is the format of a TV screen, which is how the world watched the events of 9/11 as they unfolded. The format represents how contemporary events are processed by the public, transmitted through the screens of TV or cellphone."

Woman-House,Bourgeois Louise,"Surrealism, Feminist Art",symbolic painting,"This work is titled [i]Femme Maison[/i]. And that meant to Louise Bourgeois either “woman house” or “house woman” in French. She was a native of France and always went back and forth between English and French.
In this period in the 1940s, she was raising three small boys, and so she was certainly thinking of how she felt trying to be an artist and also a stay at home mother. She chose architectural imagery to, in effect, suffocate this woman. It’s kind of dire, in a way. But on the other hand, the woman stands very upright with a certain dignity. And we can tell it's a self-portrait because the hair that comes out of the house was a signifier of Bourgeois’ own long hair.

Architecture was a motif she used throughout her career to symbolize her feelings. She saw architectural structures as a place of refuge. On the other hand, she saw that an architectural structure could also be a trap.

Bourgeois' [i]Femme Maison[/i] imagery became a symbol of the feminist art movement in the late 60s and in the 70s. Women, in particular, brought attention to the body and to issues of biography and personal feelings into artworks. Bourgeois had always been dealing with these things, so the Femme Maison image was very resonant with feminist artists, and I find that it's still resonant with women.

Balkan Erotic Epic,Abramović Marina,,,"In 2005, performance artist Marina Abramovic shot a series of seven videos depicting ancient rituals from her birthplace, the Balkans; this one re-enacts mystical rites related to fertility and virility. From medieval times to the 18th century, men and women from small villages believed they could use their sex organs as tools to improve their lives, to reach the gods: copulating with the earth to boost the crops, for example, or showing their genitals to the sky to scare the demons that caused storms. Interspersed throughout are reflections from the artist on the genesis and production of the project. Written by Richard C. Haber"
AAA-AAA,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"In this performance Abramović and Ulay stand opposite of each other and make long sounds with their mouths open. Gradually, they move closer and closer to one another, until eventually they are yelling directly into each others open mouths. The performance, which lasted 15 minutes, continued until both artist’s voices were  out of sync and failing from the continuous yelling. This piece demonstrates their interest in endurance and duration, as well as an exploration of aggression between physically present figures, one male and one female."
Breathing In/Breathing Out,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"Breathing In, Breathing Out is a performance piece by Marina Abramović and Ulay. It was performed twice, in Belgrade (1977) and Amsterdam (1978).For this performance the two artists blocked their nostrils with cigarette filters and pressed their mouths together, so that one couldn’t inhale anything else but the exhalation of the other. As the carbon dioxide filled their lungs, they began to sweat, move vehemently and wear themselves out; the viewers could sense their agony through the projected sound of breathing, which was augmented via microphones attached to their chests. It took them 19 minutes in the first performance and 15 in the second to consume all the oxygen in that one breath and reach the verge of passing out.

During the 19 minutes of the Performance at the Studenski Kulturni Centar in Belgrade, one hears the noise of their breathing in and out. Ulay commented on the Performance: ""I breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide."" Abramović: ""I breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out carbon dioxide,"" and Ulay repeated Marina’s sentence. The second part of the Performance took place in November of the same year at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. Here, breath as the giver of life becomes a symbol of keeping one another alive, of interdependence and of the interchange between male and female principle."
Imponderabilia,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,"performance, nude painting (nu)","In Imponderabilia (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers, both completely nude, stand in a doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face."
Relation in Space,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"Performed on the 16th of July at the Venice Biennale in 1976 with Ulay. In Relation in Space (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour – mixing male and female energy into the third component called ""that self."""
Rhythm 4,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"In this piece, Abramović kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan. She approached the fan slowly, attempting to breathe in as much air as possible to push the limits of her lungs. Soon after she lost consciousness."
Rhythm 0,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"Rhythm 0 (1974) was a six-hour work of performance art by Yugoslav artist Marina Abramović in Studio Morra, Naples. The work involved Abramović standing still while the audience was invited to do to her whatever they wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, and a gun loaded with one bullet.

There were no separate stages. Abramović and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work. The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: ""What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?""


Her instructions were placed on the table:

Instructions.
There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.
Performance.
I am the object.
During this period I take full responsibility.
Duration: 6 hours (8 pm – 2 am).

Abramović said the work ""pushed her body to the limits. Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss. Art critic Thomas McEvilley, who was present, wrote:

It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed so someone could suck her blood. Various minor sexual assaults were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the audience factions.""

As Abramović described it later: “What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.” ... “I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.”

When the gallery announced the work was over, and Abramović began to move again, she said the audience left, unable to face her as a person.
Rhythm 0 ranked ninth on a Complex list of the greatest works of performance art ever done."
Rhythm 2,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"Prompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramović devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from catatonia, to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off."
Rhythm 10,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"In her first performance in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramović explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body – the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramović began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. ""Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do."""
Rhythm 5,Abramović Marina,Performance Art,performance,"In this performance, Abramović sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames, propelling herself into the center of the large star. Due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that, once inside the star, the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Some members of the audience realized what had occurred only when the flames came very near to her body and she remained inert. A doctor and several members of the audience intervened and extricated her from the star.

Abramović later commented upon this experience: ""I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform."""
Parachuting Rat,Banksy,Street art,graffiti,"Parachuting Rat was an artwork in Melbourne, Australia, created by Banksy in 2003. On 26 April 2010, it was painted over by council contractors, leading to local and international coverage and debate on the nature of street art and its preservation, and new measures for its protection. Parachuting Rat was a purple rat with aviator glasses descending by parachute. Banksy's oeuvre is largely directed towards anti-capitalist and anti-war themes, and is described as distinctive in style, satirical, and provocative. Banksy himself has written, in connection with his works involving rats, 'they exist without permission. They are hated, hunted and persecuted … if you are dirty, insignificant and unloved then rats are the ultimate role model'; that 'you can win the rat race but you're still a rat'; and also that he had been painting rats for three years before someone told him that the word is an anagram of art.

Parachuting Rat was executed using stencils and spray paint. While earlier in his career Banksy painted freehand, in his later work from the mid-noughties he adopted the use of stencils in order to accelerate the creative process and reduce the likelihood of being caught. His works generally appear anonymously and overnight. Banksy has written that 'graffiti…is the most honest artform available. There is no elitism or hype … nobody is put off by the price of admission. A wall has always been the best place to publish your work'.

Melbourne is recognised as the street art capital of Australia. Banksy, who spent a few months in the city earlier in his career, described the city's street art as 'arguably Australia's most significant contribution to the arts since they stole all the Aborigines' pencils'. Parachuting Rat is one of a number of works he executed in the city in 2003. Parachuting Rat adorned the wall above a doorway of a council building behind the Forum Theatre in Hosier Lane, a tourist attraction which attracts up to a thousand people a day because of its street art. While Hosier Lane had at the time five approved areas for street art, Parachuting Rat was not in one of these. It was allowed to remain 'by exception' because the council was aware of the popularity of Banksy's works. While Melbourne has a policy of encouraging street art, it also has a problem with gangs tagging walls and public property. Melbourne's deputy Lord Mayor Susan Riley sent cleaners to Hosier Lane after residents complained about squalid conditions in the alley. The cleaners were instructed to tidy up the rat-infested garbage and remove all graffiti from unapproved street art sites. Leaving alone the approved sites, the cleaners painted over Parachuting Rat, by then thought to be the only remaining work by Banksy on public view in the city, with a thick layer of battleship-grey paint.Challenged at the time by a local resident, the cleaners replied 'we are just doing what we're told'. Andrew Bolt enquired 'what does it say about this work when cleaners cannot distinguish between graffiti and allegedly great art?'

It was again destroyed in May 2012 by builders working on plumbing. The building owner, who knows Banksy through a New York contact, said that he laughed at the fact that ""TV Cameras took an interest in his work"" in an email she sent them about the incident. Robert Doyle, Lord Mayor of Melbourne, who had recently posed for a publicity photo before Hosier Lane's street art, praised such art as 'legitimate expression of artistic intent', although he also said Parachuting Rat 'was not the Mona Lisa' and declared it an 'honest mistake' by the cleaners. Melbourne City Council CEO Kathy Alexander said it was not an error on the part of the cleaners since they had been instructed to clean all unapproved areas, and had not been informed of its cultural significance. She also highlighted that there was no legal permit for the Parachuting Rat, and acknowledged that the council should have acted sooner to approve and protect all known Banksy works. The council subsequently discussed whether it should invite artists to restore their damaged works and announced that it would issue retrospective legal permits to ensure other famous and significant works of street art are protected. The difficulty of protecting street art was also acknowledged. The council had previously attempted to protect 'Diving Bell' by Banksy by erecting a perspex sheet; its vandalism in 2008 was linked to discontent within the street art community over bureaucratic interference.

Parachuting Rat was potentially worth tens of thousands of pounds Its loss was identified as affecting tourists, artists and businesses in the area. An ABC debate suggested that street art is by nature ephemeral; that it should not be heritage-listed and protected with glass; that in restoring a painting you see not the artist's work but a representation of that work; and also raised the questions of ownership, public art, finance, and the egalitarianism of the selective preservation of works of art. Within a few days ten replacement parachute rats, in fluorescent shades of pink, blue, green and purple were created in Hosier Lane using stencils, along with another rat in the lifts of 121 Exhibition Street, the offices of the Department of Justice. An anonymous expert in Banksy and Melbourne's street art observed 'I think [Banksy] delights in placing authorities and councils in this funny position of trying to preserve his work because it's worth so much money now'. He also claimed that there were a number of other works by Banksy in the city and argued that the locations should remain undisclosed in order to protect them from destruction. Later in 2010 an image of a rat stolen from an electricity meter box outside the home of a well-known underwear designer was claimed to be by Banksy; the authenticity of this work was questioned, with some calling it a fake."
Girl with Balloon,Banksy,Graffiti Art,graffiti,"Girl with Balloon (also, Balloon Girl or Girl and Balloon) is a 2002-started London series of stencil murals by the graffiti artist Banksy, depicting a young girl with her hand extended toward a red heart-shaped balloon carried away by the wind. The first work was on Waterloo Bridge, and other murals were around London, though none remain there. Banksy has several times used variants of this design to support social campaigns: in 2005 about the West Bank barrier, in 2014 about the Syrian refugee crisis, and also about the 2017 UK election. A 2017 Samsung poll ranked Girl with Balloon as the United Kingdom's number one favourite artwork.

In 2018, a framed copy of the work spontaneously shredded during an auction, by way of a mechanical device Banksy had hidden in the frame. Banksy authenticated he was responsible for the shredding and gave the altered piece a new name, Love Is in the Bin. Sotheby said it was ""the first work in history ever created during a live auction."""
Agency Job,Banksy,Conceptual Art,genre painting,"Banksy took a copy of Millet’s 1857 painting “The Gleaners,” renamed it “Agency Job,” cutting out one of the three peasant women labouring in the fields and placing her on the frame smoking a cigarette. 
Millet had been deeply affected by the 1848 revolutions and their promise of democracy. He became the first European painter to portray the peasantry, a doomed class impoverished by advancing capitalism, in such a sympathetic and noble manner. His calm imagery, which declares, “Yes, the world can be changed into a better place,” was castigated by bourgeois society and taken up by the emerging socialist movement.
Banksy texted the media regarding his exhibition, “It’s nice to see it’s been so popular but it makes me a bit suspicious. Throughout history all the great artists have been overlooked in their own lifetime and only appreciated once they’ve gone. I’m starting to worry I’m not one of the good guys.”
It is right and proper to ask such questions of oneself and one’s work. For something “serious to happen,” which Banksy and any artist should aspire to, then a serious (not humourless) approach to art is required. Whether Banksy’s work progresses in that direction or whether he is merely co-opted to become another bad boy for the art establishment is yet to be decided."
Honk,Ruscha Edward,Pop Art,figurative,The sound and effects of a car horn are suggested through the composition and brash colours of the graphic letters which appear to come to a sudden halt on the page. Ruscha frequently used visual alliteration in this way to conjure up the words he chose to paint. ‘Honk’ suggests the artist’s fascination with cars and highways and the impact of these post-war consumer industries on cities and towns in the United States. The word is also of the type found in comic books used to bring to life the ongoing narrative.
Large Trademark With Eight Spotlights,Ruscha Edward,Pop Art,figurative,"[i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] (1962) by Edward Ruscha was one of the paintings that led to Ruscha’s rise to prominence in the early 1960s. The painting depicts the logo of the Hollywood studio 20th century Fox complete with spotlights, as it appears at the beginning of every film made by the studio. The painting’s long horizontal format (170x335cm) is even similar to a movie screen.

The idea for the painting came about during Ruscha’s trip to New York in 1961. While staying at the Hotel Governor Clinton, he created [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/trademarck-sketch-1961][i]Trademark Sketch[/i][/url] (1961), a sketch of the studio logo in ball pen drawn on hotel stationery. The sketch had a graphic quality that reflected the artist’s training and experience of working as a commercial artist for advertising companies. His time in New York in 1961 was also significant for a different reason: while there, he also saw early examples of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop Art[/url] by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein#!#resultType:masonry]Roy Lichtenstein[/url] at the [i]Leo Castelli Gallery[/i]. A year later, works like [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] marked the emergence of a West Coast school of pop art comprised of Los Angeles artists. The painting [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] is emblematic of Los Angeles: it evokes the images of the Los Angeles ‘strip’, and represents its significance as the home of the entertainment industry and the center of cinematic culture.

Both in style and choice of subject, Ruscha drew inspiration from advertising imagery. In its format, scale, stylized lines and the flattened planes of color, [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] is reminiscent of an advertising billboard. Ruscha’s literal and exaggerated translation of the 20th century Fox trademark gives the image a comical and ironic quality that is characteristic of Pop Art. In the painting, the artist also explored the relationship between the canvas, the body and the visual environment of Los Angeles. At the core of the composition is the contrast between the large stylized text and the small details. When standing in front of [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i], the composition draws the viewer’s eye to follow the perspectival lines of the text that recede to the tiny point in the lower right corner. The painting was first exhibited in May 1963 at the [i]Ferus Gallery[/i], an important staple of the Los Angeles contemporary art scene in the late 1950s and 1960s. In a gallery setting, the monumental canvas forces the viewer to step back, and walk back and forth to fully appreciate the painting.

This was a chief concern for Ruscha, in multiple paintings from the period he applied different strategies in order to examine different ways in which the viewer can engage with the painting. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/actual-size-1962][i]Actual Size[/i][/url] (1962) for instance, Ruscha played with scale, creating a contrast between the large and the small text. Like [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i], [i]Actual Size[/i] engages the viewer by tempting them to examine the painting from up close as well as from afar. Today, [i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i] is part of the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York."
Actual Size,Ruscha Edward,Pop Art,figurative,"One of the best-known examples of Edward Rusha’s early works is the painting [i]Actual Size[/i] (1962). Like his contemporaries in New York, Pop Artists[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol] Andy Warhol[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein]Roy Lichtenstein[/url], Ruscha focused on subjects that relate to mass production and consumer culture. [i]Actual Size[/i] focuses on a can of Spam, a staple in American society during the Cold War era. The top half of the painting depicts the giant brand name from the can of Spam, while the lower half shows the actual can of spam in its true size. The can of Spam seems to be shooting into space like a comet or a cannonball. In small print behind the can, Ruscha wrote ‘Actual Size’. The written text and the title refer to a phrase borrowed from the world of advertising, used to refer to the accuracy of the depiction.

Like other figures in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art#!#resultType:masonry]Pop Art[/url], Ruscha monumentalized the common object: he challenged the traditional notions of fine art by painting mundane objects like the mass produced can of spam. [i]Actual Size[/i] highlights consumerism and the strong presence of these commodities in popular culture. The contrast between the top and the bottom of the painting highlighted the mechanisms of advertising: the top half shows an oversized and flashy brand name while the bottom that depicts the product in its actual size. The rapid rise of outdoor advertising changed the visual landscapes of American cities in the 1960s, and artists like Ruscha were reacting to these social and cultural shifts. [i]Actual Size[/i] can be viewed as a critique of the superficial and shallow nature of American popular culture that often encourages the glorification of junk. However, as is the case with many Pop Artists, Ruscha’s stance toward popular culture is ambiguous. The artist has often commented about his fondness of the artificial and superficial elements of American mass culture. [i]Actual Size[/i] also demonstrates this ambiguity: the monumental depiction of the can of spam is humorous and ironic, but at the same time, the choice of subject shows the dominance of commercial imagery in popular culture.

Still, [i]Actual Size[/i] is more than just an ironic depiction of advertising and consumer culture imagery. In the painting, the artist deals with fundamental questions of composition and scale. [i]Actual Size[/i] invites a comparison between the top and bottom half, and the painting draws the viewer close to canvas since one has to be near the canvas to read the words ‘actual size’ written in pencil. The viewer needs to observe the painting both from close and from afar to fully appreciate all of its elements. Other early paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/flash-l-a-times-1963][i]Flash, L.A Times[/i][/url] (1963) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/large-trademark-with-eight-spotlights-1962][i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i][/url] (1962) also explored issues of scale and proportion. Therefore, while Ruscha’s early paintings commented on American consumer culture, they also touched upon subjects fundamental to issues of composition and painting."
The Los Angeles County Museum on Fire,Ruscha Edward,Pop Art,cityscape,"The city of Los Angeles plays a significant role in the art of Edward Ruscha, and in turn, Ruscha is among the most prominent representatives of the city’s art scene. One of his most intriguing paintings is [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i] (1965-1968), in which the artist chose to depict then newly built art museum set ablaze. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LAMCA), is a three building complex designed by architect William Pereira. Shortly after the building opened to the public in 1965, Ruscha began painting [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i]. When initially exhibited in 1968 at the [i]Irving Blum Gallery[/i] in Los Angeles, Rusha announced via telegram that the fire marshal would be on hand to see “[i]the most controversial painting to be shown in Los Angeles in our time[/i]”. In this spirit, the painting was placed behind a velvet rope, as if to hold back angry crowds.

Ruscha depicted the new LACMA building in precise detail. In order to capture this aerial point of view of the museum building he used preparatory photographs taken from a helicopter. Throughout the years, the painting provoked different interpretations among art critics and historians. Most often, scholars have interpreted the painting as a critique of cultural and art institutions: while the new building was a way of enhance the legitimacy of the Los Angeles art community, Ruscha, as one of its leading representatives expressed a growing sense of alienation from the city’s art scene and its institutions. Others, however, understood the painting as a playful statement on the rising status of Los Angles art - the city’s art scene is so in demand that it is ‘on fire’.  Another interpretation suggested [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i] was an allusion to the Watts riots that happened in Los Angeles in the summer of 1965. The riots, a result of racial tensions between the local community and the authorities, led to six days of conflict that resulted in 34 deaths and extensive property damage. The aerial photographs Ruscha used while painting [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i] were the same mode of surveillance the Los Angeles Police Department applied when the city was engulfed in flames during the Watts riots. It is possible that the painting melded the two different realities happening in Los Angeles at the time.

Ruscha generally rejected all of these interpretations arguing that he was mainly interested in depicting the ambiguity between serene and chaotic elements. He painted an elegant composition and a clean architectural structure, while a fire bursts from the back section of the complex. This kind of detachment amplifies a sense of uneasiness, and the artist builds tension through this contrast. In several interviews, Ruscha stated that the painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-eurich/withdrawal-from-dunkirk-june-1940-1940][i]Withdrawal of Dunkrik[/i][/url] (1940) by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-eurich]Richard Eurich[/url] served as the inspiration for [i]Los Angeles County Museum on Fire[/i]. Even though Ruscha chose to focus on the formal elements of the painting, the context, the timing and the choice of subject still suggest a strong connection to the social and cultural development of Los Angeles."
The End #1,Ruscha Edward,Pop Art,figurative,"[i]The End #1[/i] (1993) belongs to a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-end,resultType:masonry]series of paintings, drawings and prints by Edward Ruscha that feature the text ‘The End’[/url]. These artworks, produced during the 1990s and 2000s, were inspired by the memory and history of cinema. Since Ruscha’s move to Los Angeles in 1956, the city and its film industry have played a central part in his art. Artworks like the paintings [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/large-trademark-with-eight-spotlights-1962][i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i][/url] (1962), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/hollywood-1969][i]Hollywood[/i][/url] (1969) and the photo book, [i]Every Building on the Sunset Strip[/i] (1966) drew inspiration from the city’s landscape and its role in creating Hollywood myth and fantasy. For the series, provoked by his personal memories of watching movies and going to the cinema, Ruscha chose to single out the final frame of the movie. By choosing to depict the cinematic version of the final curtain, the series touches upon concepts of finality. However for Ruscha, the idea of ‘The End’ is not necessarily negative, it serves more as a signifier for change – a simple sign that the movie is no longer rolling.

[i]The End #1[/i] is a small monochrome painting, which depicts a split second of a film projection between two successive frames. The two frames split by a white line show cropped letters of the phrase ‘The End’ painted in a Gothic style font. The grey surfaces are covered with small marks and blemishes, like the ones seen during the projection of a degraded film. The artist emphasized the flaws in cinema, the small zips, scratches and blemishes on a film reel. Ruscha chose to concentrate on the imperfections that film producers tried to obscure and hide, explaining how there is beauty in the aging of things. The text ‘The End’ signifies more than the ending of a movie, it suggests the ending of a chapter in cinema history. The painting conveys a sense of nostalgia for a film technology that became obsolete and forgotten. The artist memorializes this in [i]The End #1[/i], fully aware that future audiences might not understand the idea behind the painting, since there will be no more scratches on film.

In his analysis of the [i]The End[/i] series, art curator, Ralph Rugoff argued that these paintings are part of Ruscha’s broader engagement with themes of decline and decay. Paintings like [i]The End #1[/i], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/the-end-1991][i]The End[/i][/url] (1991) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/the-final-end-1992][i]The Final End[/i][/url] (1992) explore the reality of material decay, how time and natural conditions affect the projected image. Because of its smooth surface, [i]The End #1[/i] was likely spray painted with an airbrush. Although Ruscha initially hated the airbrush, and felt it was incompatible with fine art, he began experimenting with the technique in the 1980s. He found the style unique, and called it ‘strokeless painting’ because of the flat and smooth finish the technique achieved. The straight lines around the edges and across the canvas were probably made with the help of masking tape, a method Ruscha used for another painting of the series, [i]The Final End[/i]."
Pay Nothing Until April,Ruscha Edward,"Conceptual Art, Pop Art",landscape,"[i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] (2003) by Edward Ruscha belongs to a large group of paintings, which depict a natural landscape overlayed with text. Ruscha used the scheme for nearly five decades: from early examples in the 1980s such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/not-a-bad-world-is-it-1984][i]Not A Bad World, Is It?[/i][/url] (1984) up to recent paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/wall-rocket-2013][i]Wall Rocket[/i][/url] (2013) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/tulsa-slut-2016][i]Tulsa Slut[/i][/url] (2016). 

[i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] depicts snow-covered mountaintops against a yellow sky, that signifies a sunset or a sunrise. For paintings like [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] the artist usually appropriated landscapes from postcard images of different mountain ranges. The process of creating the painting began with a thin layer of paint sprayed onto the canvas. Later, the artist worked on the landscape in acrylic paint, and finally applied the lettering by using stencils. The font, named [i]Boy Scout Utility Modern[/i], was designed by Ruscha in the 1980s. The artist described it as a ‘no style’ typeface, and he has used it in many of his subsequent works.

When describing the concept behind painting, Ruscha stated: [i]‘It’s not a celebration of nature. I’m not trying to show beauty. It’s more like I’m painting ideas of ideas of mountains. The concept came to me as a logical extension of the landscapes that I’ve been painting for a while – horizontal landscapes, flatlands, the landscape I grew up in. Mountains like this were only ever a dream to me; they meant Canada or Colorado’[/i]. In other words, Ruscha purposefully chose to paint the landscape in an impersonal and detached manner from distant images found on souvenirs. Combined with the text ‘Pay Nothing Until April’, the painting is reminiscent of a poster in the window or an advertising for a bargain ski holiday. In particular, the text is similar to the advertising slogan formula ‘Buy Now, Pay Nothing until April’. Advertising and consumer culture are consistent themes in Ruscha’s art. [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] continues this exploration by mimicking the aesthetic of mass produced culture.

Another important element in Ruscha’s art is his living and working environment, the city of Los Angeles. In particular, Los Angeles as the center of the entertainment industry has played a significant role in Ruscha’s work in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/large-trademark-with-eight-spotlights-1962][i]Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights[/i][/url] (1962) and his photo book, [i]Every Building on the Sunset Strip[/i] (1966).  The mountain peaks of [i]Pay Nothing Until April[/i] can be linked to visual images from adventure movies such as the James Bond film [i]On Her Majesty’s Secret Service[/i] (1969). Another possible inspiration was the logo of Paramount Pictures, one of Hollywood’s largest production companies. Through these associations to consumerist imagery and culture, the artist removed the mystique and sublime qualities of the natural landscape. Unlike the sublime landscapes of the 19th century European [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism#!#resultType:masonry]Romantic[/url] painters, that celebrated the power and greatness of nature, Ruscha’s painting embraces the banality of consumerist culture by covering the landscape with an advertising slogan. This is also a reflection of Los Angeles, a place Ruscha called ‘the ultimate cardboard town’."
"Angry Because It's Plaster, Not Milk",Ruscha Edward,Surrealism,animal painting,"A loosely painted bird, hovering in an indeterminate space, is crying over unspilled milk in a painting which contains a representation of a sculptural trompe l’oeil. If not for the title, we, two, might be fooled into thinking that the glass contains milk, but not necessarily because it looks like milk. Even Ruscha, who is a master of the most sophisticated trompe l’ouiel effects (which he has chosen not to deploy here) could not have painted the difference between plaster and milk. He has relied on us to make the same assumptions as the bird, and he has relied on our ability to read and reveal to us the content of our assumptions. Unlike the bird, we exit laughing. Ruscha has painted an updated version of the story of a painting contest which took place in Greece during the fifth-century B.C.E. The painter Zeuxis showed a still life of such realism that birds flew down to eat the grapes from the painting. Ruscha has moved that scene to America (note that he portrays a glass of milk instead of grapes) and painted it from the point of view of one of the deceived birds. Unlike the Greeks, he does not believe that the best paintings are the most realistic."
Sleeping girl,Delaunay Sonia,Fauvism,portrait,"[i]Sleeping Girl[/i] refers to the early period of Sonia Delaunay. The famous abstract artist started her career with figurative images where the influence of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism]Fauvism[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/expressionism]Expressionism[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/post-impressionism]Post-Impressionism[/url] is evident.

In front of us is a sleeping girl. Unlike the traditional composition for such a plot, she sleeps in a sitting position, leaning with her hand on an invisible sofa. The image spreads the mood of relaxation, harmony, and peace. The soft lines of the face are combined with cold colors, which suggest a nocturnal image: the color combination of the image would have been attenuated if it hadn't been for the scarlet lips, the redness of the cheeks, the reflections on the hand. The pink color creates a feeling of freshness and youth.

We can easily trace the remarkable influence of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin]Gauguin[/url] here. A luxuriant body, bright colors, full lips, a contoured outline, and a feeling of physical health and vitality equals [i]Sleeping Girl[/i] to Gauguin's [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_1st-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry]Tahitian art[/url]."
Simultaneous Dress,Delaunay Sonia,Orphism,design,"Delaunay's passion for exploring the way complementary colors (one primary with one secondary) reacted to one another, was not contained to a fine art. In fact, she boldly applied this expressive technique to areas in which artistic exploration was formerly not noted, such as the world of fashion and home décor. She eventually built a career in designing fashions for dresses, driving caps, swimsuits, shoes, and scarves. This dress is of particular importance because it was one of the earliest examples of her unique ""simultaneous"" dresses."
Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France,Delaunay Sonia,Orphism,illustration,"[i]La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France[/i] (Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France) is a collaborative artists' book by Blaise Cendrars and Sonia Delaunay. The book features a poem by Cendrars about the poet's journey through Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express in 1905, during the first Russian Revolution, together with Jeanne, a French prostituted girl. The text interlaced with an almost-abstract pochoir print by Delaunay. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone in the evolution of artist's books as well as modernist poetry and abstract art.

This long-format illustration can be considered a ""simultaneous book."" It is a two-meter long book, pleated in the manner of an accordion, exhibiting the artist's technique of manipulating color for maximum expression. Patches of non-uniformly shaped color and text printed in different colors (not the expected black) and typefaces, guide the reader around the text and reflect the mood and content of Cendrars' poem. The planned print run of 150 copies was purposefully meant to reach 300 feet high (if all copies are connected end-to-end) - the height of the Eiffel Tower.

The publisher of a 2008 reprint of the book has called it ""one of the most beautiful books ever created"". Cendrars himself referred to the work as ‘[i]a sad poem printed on sunlight[/i]’."
The Ball,Delaunay Sonia,Orphism,genre painting,"""The title of this painting when first presented at the Der Sturm gallery in Berlin in 1913 - Mouvement, couleur, profondeur, danse, Bullier (Motion colour, depth, dance, Bullier) - sums up the artist's ambition to transcribe movement with colour-forms. The panoramic format of the canvas unfolds arabesques of dancing couples, swirling about under the halos of the electric lights of the Bal Bullier, a dance hall on the Boulevard Saint-Michel frequented by the Delaunays. The theme of dance, both a means of depicting movement and emblematic of the dynamism of modern life, favours the fragmentation of form and its dissolution into abstract planes."""
Electric Prisms,Delaunay Sonia,Orphism,abstract,"[i]Prismes électriques[/i] is focused around two large overlapping circles created by arcs or curved forms of primary and secondary colors placed one beside the other. The remainder of the canvas is covered by other areas of color noted in a variety of shapes both geometric, such as arcs, rectangles, and oval-like shapes, more abstract and all connected as if sewn together like a tapestry.

This work also exemplifies the way that life influenced Delaunay's art. Apparently she and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-delaunay]Robert[/url] were walking down the boulevard Saint-Michel when they came upon newly installed electric lamplights. Both artists tried to recreate the impressive glow from these new inventions in their artwork. In this painting, we see how Sonia tried to replicate the way these artificial lights cast colors onto the sidewalk beneath by sketching rapid, semi-circular colored lines."
"Simultaneous Dresses (Three Women, Forms, Colours)",Delaunay Sonia,Orphism,design,"This painting was originally called [i]Trois femmes, forms, couleurs[/i] (Three Women, Forms, Colours), as stated on the label affixed to the back of the painting for the exhibition held at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1926. However, the painter changed this title to [i]Simultaneous Dresses[/i] in her personal inventory.

Sonia Delaunay had been interested in clothing from a very early age, but it was not until 1917, when the revolution cut off her money supply from Russia, that she devoted herself to fashion design as a means of subsistence. After the Delaunays settled in Madrid, Sonia began designing costumes for Diaghilev’s [i]Ballets Russes[/i], which had also taken refuge in the Spanish capital, and to work for the fashion industry. In 1919, encouraged by a string of successes in this field, Sonia opened her first shop in Madrid — [i]Casa Sonia[/i] — setting a precedent for the [i]Boutique Simultané[/i] established in Paris in 1924.

Sonia’s first [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sonia-delaunay/simultaneous-dress-1913][i]Simultaneous dress[/i][/url], created in 1913 to dance the tango at the Bal Bullier, was an original piece defined by Apollinaire as “a living painting” and “a sculpture of living forms.” Sonia designed her dresses by joining together small pieces of fabrics in different forms and textures; she combined her simultaneous colors with prints and paired luxury fabrics with coarser textiles, shortened hemlines and sleeves, and lightened shapes, thereby achieving a totally modern image.

[i]Simultaneous Dresses[/i] from the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection belongs to a group of paintings in which the painter transfers to canvas the result of her experiments on paper as a fashion designer. Of the three dresses featured in this work, that worn by the central figure reproduces Sonia’s design for the film actress Gloria Swanson. The painting was created for the exhibition held at the Grand Palais in Paris, in 1926."
"Wearing the Pierrot-Éclair costume designed by Sonia Delaunay, on the set of René Le Somptier’s film Le P’tit Parigot",Delaunay Sonia,Orphism,design,"Sonia Delaunay's exploration of expressive color in the field of textile design differentiates her significantly from other members of the contemporary avant-garde. Besides designing, making, and selling garments in her own fashion boutique, she was responsible for costume design in a range of the performing arts, including theatre and dance. She ended up creating a line of textiles so significant that it was picked up by one of the biggest fabric manufacturers in Europe.

The Pierrot mask originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century. His character is a servant immediately identifiable by his baggy white costume. Pierrot is a reliable, astute servant, with a knack for setting people up but also helping get his master out of scrapes. 

This shot was made on the set of Rene Le Somptier's film [i]Le p'tit parigot[/i]  (The Small Parisian), 1926. The costume of Pierrot created by Delaunay went beyond the traditional depiction of this character. While keeping the amplitude of the outfit, traditional shoes, a big collar, the artist created an avant-garde image. Broken lines cross the costume; the collar is transformed into a pure form, amplified by three concentric circles. In this costume, Delaunay applied her theory of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/orphism-simultanism]Simultanism[/url], suggesting movements and vibrations through lines. Her textiles and fashion designs of the 1920s saw Simultanism escape the confines of art and go directly to the streets, into everyday life. As in her [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sonia-delaunay/simultaneous-dress-1913][i]Simultaneous dress[/i][/url], her costumes suggested movement in the concept of the design and a transformation of the female body."
Moustaches,Arp Jean,Surrealism,abstract,"Arp developed a distinctive repertoire of abstracted shapes for his sculptural reliefs. The same motifs, repeated from work to work, were intended as a kind of ‘object language’. One of these symbols was the moustache, which Arp associated with pomposity. A common affectation of figures of authority, the moustache embodied the spirit of bourgeois stupidity that had precipitated the First World War. It was only around the time of making this work that the German-born Arp secured his French nationality, having been stateless since refusing to fight in the war."
Constellation According to the Laws of Chance,Arp Jean,Surrealism,abstract,"Arp felt that modern society had become over-dependent on reason. He hoped to redress the balance by developing an art that consciously evoked the forms and laws of nature without copying them. The rounded shapes in this relief may suggest clouds or planets, while the ‘laws’ of the title are those of flux and chance that characterise the ‘inaccessible order’ of nature. Arp’s interest in chance extended to the making of his reliefs. He ordered them from a craftsman, but left his instructions ambiguous in order to encourage the craftsman's free interpretation."
According to the Laws of Chance,Arp Jean,Dada,abstract,"Arp felt that he could incorporate chance within artistic production, comparing the role of the artist to a plant bearing fruit. According to the Laws of Chance shows Arp playing with random composition, in this case dropping painted pieces of paper onto a surface. Torn Woodcut was made in a similar way in 1954, using the pieces of a Dada print he had made in 1920."
Torn-Up Woodcut,Arp Jean,Dada,abstract,"Arp felt that he could incorporate chance within artistic production, comparing the role of the artist to a plant bearing fruit. According to the Laws of Chance shows Arp playing with random composition, in this case dropping painted pieces of paper onto a surface. Torn Woodcut was made in a similar way in 1954, using the pieces of a Dada print he had made in 1920."
Danger of Death (T05007),Arp Jean,Automatic Painting,abstract,"‘Danger of Death’ is one of a number of drawings by Arp of the 1950s and 1960s with wavering lines, called by Arp ‘Erdbebenlinie’ (‘earthquake’ or ‘seismic lines’). Arp continued in this period to sculpt and draw using the curving, organic shapes for which he is best known. However, in certain drawings and prints he used the tremulous quality of such ‘earthquake lines’ to express the unplanned nature and uncertain development of his imagery, and also to explore the distinction between abstract and representational marks.

The apparently random, non-representational quality of many of the lines in T05007 appears to suggest that the artist let his pencil move across the paper in an ‘automatic’ fashion, in the manner of the ‘automatic drawings’ produced by the Paris-based Surrealist group from the mid-1920s. However, the fainter pencil marks and partial erasures, which are plainly visible in T05007, are proof of preliminary work, and suggest a degree of premeditation.

The ‘mortal danger’ referred to in the title of T05007 may be related to Arp's discussion here of the risk of spiritual atrophy within ‘pure’ abstraction, and of the dangers of global destruction at the time of the Cold War. However, the title may also have had a more personal meaning. Following the accidental death of his wife Sophie Taeuber-Arp in 1943, Arp had been drawn increasingly to religion and mysticism, and much of his subsequent work can be seen as meditations on life and death. He suffered severe bouts of depression, and in 1952 he had a heart attack, from which he was slow to recover. With his own health fragile, he was perhaps striving in this period to come to terms with the idea of his own death."
Head,Taeuber-Arp Sophie,Dada,sculpture,"Taeuber-Arp, a pioneering abstract artist, was trained in the applied and fine arts and ascribed equal importance to both. In 1920, at the time Head was made, she was best known for her arts-and-crafts creations, including textile designs, turned-wood containers, beaded necklaces, notebook covers, and bags. Head combines mechanically produced turned-wood pieces and beaded ornaments typically associated with domestic handicrafts to create a sculpture that challenges the boundaries separating craft from fine art.

The work strongly resembles Study for a Marionette (Portrait of H.A.) (1918), an abstract depiction of the artist Jean (Hans) Arp, whom Taeuber-Arp would marry in 1922. Both works have bobbin-shaped bases, trapezoidal noses, oval heads, and cylindrical necks, and they have similar dimensions. This suggests that Head is a counterpart to the earlier work, and a stylized self-portrait. Taeuber-Arp made this sculpture in Zurich, where she had become associated with Dada, a cultural movement that embraced absurdity and abstraction as avenues to a radical rethinking of contemporary social, political, and aesthetic conventions.

Untitled,Taeuber-Arp Sophie,,abstract,"Taeuber-Arp made this “needle-painting” when she was working as an applied arts teacher and participating in the Zurich Dada movement, which sought to challenge traditional values in art, often with humor and playfulness. One of her smallest embroideries, this abstract textile might have originally functioned as a study for a larger tapestry or pillow cover. However, by placing the textile within an oversized gilded frame, she wittily transformed it into a “fine” art object not unlike a religious image or icon.

The Artist and His Mother,Gorky Arshile,Post-Impressionism,"portrait, self-portrait","[i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] (1926-1936) represents the pinnacle of Arshile Gorky’s figurative paintings. It is based on a photograph of the painter and his mother, taken in 1912 in his native country Armenia. Only three years later, the Ottoman Empire began the systematic extermination of the Armenian people, known as the Armenian Genocide. Even though Gorky and his family survived a death march, the ordeal caused permanent damage. His mother’s health particularly suffered, and in 1919, she died of malnourishment.

Gorky began working on the double portrait in 1926 and worked toward the final version over the next decade. During this period, Gorky made many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artists-s-mother]preparatory sketches[/url] and studies. For example, two quick pen sketches drawn side by side were used to set up the composition and arrangement of the painting. In another pencil sketch, the artist created a detailed study for the painting by using a grid with numbered squares to enlarge the drawing. He also created another version of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artist-and-his-mother-1942][i]The Artist and His Mother[/i][/url] (ca.1926-1942) in a warmer color palette. Still, this version does not appear to be as sharp and precise in its painterly treatment and finishing touches.

In [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i], Gorky applied and scrapped thin layers to give the surface the soft glow of marble or porcelain. He painted stiff figures in cool and muted colors, blending patches of ochre, blue, green, and brown. The figure of the mother resembles a statue, due to the severe posture and the flat surface of the apron that looks like a smooth piece of marble or stone. In terms of style, [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i] was influenced by the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], especially the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-gertrude-stein-1906][i]Portrait of Gertrude Stein[/i][/url] (1906). In this painting and other portraits, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/portrait-of-vartoosh-1937][i]Portrait of Vartoosh[/i][/url] (1936-1937), the artist paid particular attention to the eyes. For Gorky, expressive eyes were characteristic Armenian features. As a child, he might have seen in his native village medieval religious paintings and manuscripts that highlighted these features. Later, while visiting American museums, Gorky discovered Russian icons, and the large eyes in Sumerian and Hittite art, which he associated with his ancestry in the Caucuses.

The horrible events that shaped Gorky’s early life and the traumatic loss of his mother come across in [i]The Artist and His Mother[/i]. When painting the scene, Gorky chose to leave parts unfinished. By erasing the two hands of his mother, he injected a sense of violence into the painting. The figures in Gorky’s art, especially his mother, seem to disintegrate in the same way that memories become more elusive with time. Gorky transformed the old photograph into introspection on his mind: on the canvas, he reconstructed the complex emotional response to the photograph. The statue-like figure of the mother, the hollow eyes, and the numb expression make her seem almost ghost-like. In comparison, the figure of the young boy has three dimensions and a distinctly sad expression. For Gorky, the painting was an expression of personal loss, and for many others, it became a symbol of the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide."
Aviation: Evolution of Forms under Aerodynamic Limitations,Gorky Arshile,"Cubism, Surrealism",abstract,"Arshile Gorky’s ten-panel [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/mural]mural[/url] [i]Aviation: Evolution of Forms under Aerodynamic Limitations[/i] (1937) created for the Newark Airport in New Jersey tells a fascinating story of the collision of art and politics. Gorky designed and executed the mural as part of the WPA Federal Art Project, a New Deal program that supported artists during the Great Depression. He joined the Federal Art Project in 1935, where he was commissioned to work as a muralist. Gorky was highly regarded by several people in the organization, who appreciated and supported his abstract style.

Initially, Gorky created a design for the Floyd Bennett Airfield in New York City. He found objects in the airfield, which were then photographed by Wyatt Davis, the brother of American painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/stuart-davis]Stuart Davis[/url]. Gorky used the photographs as sources for his drawings and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/study-for-aviation-evolution-of-forms-under-aerodynamic-limitations-newark-airport-mural-35-36-1936]studies in gouache[/url]. In some cases, he created collages that incorporated cutouts of the photographs into the drawn designs. In the collages, Gorky disassociated the different parts of the airplane into basic shapes that reflected their function. His designs were inspired by European modernism: the language of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetic-cubism]Synthetic Cubism[/url] prominent in the art of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Georges Braque[/url] as well as the mural paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fernand-leger]Fernand Léger[/url] who argued that pure colors and geometric forms were meant for walls and large surfaces rather than easel paintings. Like Léger in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/fernand-leger/peinture-murale-mural-painting-1924-0][i]Peinture murale (Mural Painting)[/i][/url] (1924), Gorky’s palette centered on primary colors. Additionally, these colors corresponded to the colors painted on the machinery and the graphic signs on the airplanes.

In late 1935, Gorky presented his mural design for the Floyd Bennett Airfield to New York Mayor La Guardia at an exhibition held at the Federal Art Gallery. He explained how he aimed to show the object simultaneously from all sides and how his abstract style was in tune with contemporary life. Even though La Guardia did not critique Gorky directly, he made comments that showed his disdain for abstract art. In subsequent reports, the press published La Guardia’s comments, presenting them as criticisms of Gorky. Ultimately, the Floyd Bennett project was assigned to a competitor who submitted a figurative design, but Gorky was transferred to a more prominent project, the mural at Newark Airport. Gorky’s original design was for one large panel, so the artist made appropriate adjustments to accommodate the new space in Newark - a total of ten panels.

The Newark mural was one of the highlights of Gorky’s career; besides, but it was more than a personal accomplishment. Gorky was a champion of abstract art, and this mural was an artistic statement. [i]Aviation: Evolution of Forms under Aerodynamic Limitations[/i] was the most massive abstract mural executed within the Federal Art Project, and offered a unique opportunity to create an abstract artwork that would engage with the broad public. The panels were mounted in June 1937, but they were displaced during World War II when the airport was under the control of the Air Force. The missing murals were discovered in the 1970s and were first presented to the public in the winter of 1978-1979."
The Garden in Sochi,Gorky Arshile,Surrealism,abstract,"[i]The Garden in Sochi[/i] (ca. 1943) belongs to a group of paintings by Arshile Gorky, which relates to the theme of his childhood memories in his native country Armenia. Here, and in an earlier version [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/garden-in-sochi-1][i]The Garden in Sochi[/i][/url] (1941), the artist was inspired by memories of his father’s garden and farm. Although the title implies that the location is Sochi, a Russian resort town on the north shore of the Black Sea, Gorky’s father farm was actually on the shore of Lake Van. Another possibility is that the title alludes to the Armenian word for poplar tree, [i]sos[/i] or [i]sosi[/i]. The poplar tree is beloved in Armenia, and for Gorky, it also held special significance. His family had a custom of planting a poplar tree every time a son was born, and later the child’s name and birthdate would be carved into the tree. In a letter to his sister, he also mentioned that he thought it would be better to name the paintings after a popular place that Americans were more likely to know.

The artist elaborated on the images he associated with his father’s garden. He remembered an uncultivated orchard with old apple trees that created dense shade, fields with wild carrots and porcupines, and a large dead tree and blue rock that local villagers believed had supernatural powers. People passing by the ‘Holy Tree’ would tear small pieces of clothing and hang them on the tree as good omens. Similarly, women would come to the blue rock and rub their breasts against it, believing this would help with their fertility. In [i]The Garden in Sochi[/i], Gorky reimagined the natural scenery and rural rituals through a colorful composition of biomorphic shapes. Some shapes resemble Gorky’s description of the garden, for example, the forms in the upper right corner look like a tree with thin branches blowing in the wind, and the shapes in the lower left corner possibly represent a female figure. Stylistically, the artist was influenced by the works of Spanish surrealist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url]. [i]The Garden in Sochi[/i] shares a resemblance with Miró’s signature biomorphic forms seen in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/nude][i]Nude[/i][/url] (1926) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/painting-1][i]Painting[/i][/url] (1933). However, this was not the artist’s only inspiration: many Armenian manuscripts in Gorky’s native province of Van have sharply pointed forms of slippers and draperies, and abstract motifs of birds and animals.

The “Sochi” group of the painting represents an essential phase in Gorky’s artistic development. These paintings continue Gorky’s emulation and synthesis of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s cubist style and Miró’s biomorphic forms that were already seen in his late 1930s paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/child-of-an-idumean-night-composition-no-4][i]Child of Idumean Night (Composition No.4)[/i][/url] (ca.1936) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/image-in-khorkom][i]Khorkom[/i][/url] (ca.1936). In comparison to the 1941 version, the composition of the 1943 T[i]he Garden of Sochi[/i] is more open, and the white background gives the painting a sense of airiness. Most significantly, in [i]The Garden of Sochi[/i] Gorky separated the function of the line and color. It was a critical development for Gorky’s mature style as is evident in the later painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-liver-is-the-cock-s-comb][i]The Liver is the Cock’s Crumb[/i][/url] (1944)."
The Liver is the Cock's Comb,Gorky Arshile,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"[i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] (1944) is one of Arshile Gorky’s largest and most noteworthy paintings. It combined several influences that marked the emergence of Gorky’s mature original style. The artist blended elements of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url], specifically from the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Pablo Picasso[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url]. Additionally, the color range in [i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] can be connected to the works of Russian artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky]Wassily Kandinsky[/url], much admired by Gorky. Another prominent figure that helped in Gorky’s artistic development was Chilean surrealist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roberto-matta]Roberto Matta[/url]. He advised Gorky to thin his paints with turpentine, which allowed the colors to run, smudge, and drip, acquiring a translucent quality. It made the colors in [i]The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i] more vibrant and sensuous than in earlier works, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/garden-in-sochi][i]The Garden in Sochi[/i][/url] (1943).

Gorky was inspired by nature, his physical surroundings, as well as by memories of his father’s garden in Armenia. The artist aimed to present complexities and contradictions of his life, and so the painting and its title hold multiple layers of meaning. The peculiar title was the result of Gorky’s collaboration with the surrealist André Breton on New Year’s Eve 1944. Breton, the author of the [i]Surrealist Manifesto[/i], praised the artwork, stating it was one of the most famous paintings produced in America. On a superficial level, some shapes resemble livers floating in space, while other crown-like forms are similar to a cock’s combs. However, some have suggested that these shapes were products of the artist’s imagination, and as such, they did not represent any particular object found in nature.

Furthermore, scholars have offered other explanations that give the title a range of meanings. The liver was considered the ancient organ of love, and the phrase [i]cock’s comb[/i] can be interpreted as a sexual pun. In this case, the title could mean that love is lust, making the painting a representation of passion and desire. Therefore, the shapes can signify biological organisms or human reproductive organs freely floating in space. Another possibility is that the pun [i]cock’s comb[/i] refers to conceit or vanity. If the word [i]liver[/i] is understood as the one who lives, the title could be a statement: one who is actively alive already engaged in the greatest of vanities.

The painting was based on a drawing done the previous year, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/study-for-the-liver-is-the-cocks-comb-1943][i]Study for The Liver is the Cock’s Comb[/i][/url] (1943). It was not uncommon: before creating oil paintings, Gorky usually made several preparatory sketches and studies. In this way, he established the foundations of the painting in terms of color and composition. Still, when working with oil paint, Gorky improvised in some sections by changing color areas or adding new shapes. Overall, Gorky preserved the graphic style seen in the drawing but accentuated the contours and colors, which resulted in a fantastical and mysterious landscape."
Agony,Gorky Arshile,Surrealism,abstract,"Many art historians have linked Arshile Gorky’s [i]Agony[/i] (1947) to the struggles and hardships the artist experienced before committing suicide on July 21st, 1948. Indeed, the personal disasters came one after another: it began in January 1946 with a fire in his studio that led to the destruction of multiple paintings, and a painful cancer operation that happened a month later. During this time, Gorky’s physical and mental state deteriorated. In 1948, he broke his neck and lost the use of his painting arm in a car accident. Soon after, his wife left him taking their two daughters to her mother's home in Virginia. The accumulation of physical and emotional agony ultimately proved too much for Gorky to bear. He hanged himself, having left a note “Goodbye my loved”. 

Like the title suggests, [i]Agony[/i] is a blazing scene in terms of its color palette and sharp lines. In the dark and dramatic color scheme, browns and maroons dominate the background, while patches of yellow, red, and black form the central motifs. The color scheme plays a pivotal role in expressing the theme of agony, especially when comparing the painting to Gorky’s preparatory sketches. In [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/study-for-agony-1947][i]Study for Agony[/i][/url] (ca. 1946-1947), for instance, the scene seems much more erratic than in the final painting. However, in a final version, Gorky preserved the fundamental elements of the composition and the central motifs of the painting.

[i]Agony[/i] ignited the imagination of scholars, who looked for symbols and images in Gorky’s abstract forms. Interpretations were mainly connected to the tragic circumstances of the artist's final years. [i]Agony[/i] appears to be a furnished interior, with the horizontal line crossing the canvas marking the line of the floor. Gorky’s first biographer, American painter Ethel Schwabacher viewed [i]Agony[/i] as a ‘battle of the sexes’. She linked the painting to an earlier set of drawings, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/fireplace-in-virginia][i]Fireplace in Virginia[/i][/url] (1946), that showed an interior setting similar to the one in [i]Agony[/i]. [i]Fireplace in Virginia[/i] could have referred to the home of Gorky’s in-laws in Virginia. What distinguishes the drawing from the painting is the mood: the atmosphere shifts from an air of content and hospitality in [i]Fireplace in Virginia[/i] to a spirit of fierce conflict in [i]Agony[/i], which reveals itself in the patches of fiery red. 

Others continued this interpretation by associating the forms in the painting with human figures and even specific details from Gorky’s biography. On the lower right side, the shape resembles a figure bowing toward the center of the composition. From the upper right corner, a large disc enters the space, which in some of the sketches bears a face. The most dominant figure at the center arouses gruesome associations of a hanging corpse. In studies of the painting, Gorky paid particular attention to the development of this figure, altering small details and shifting the silhouette. Since [i]Agony[/i] was painted before Gorky’s suicide, it is possible that the artist consciously or unconsciously expressed his intentions thoughts through his art."
Moment,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"[i]Moment[/i] (1946) captures an important point in Barnett Newman’s career and artistic evolution. The artist destroyed most of his artworks from the1930s and the early 1940s in order to set himself on a new creative path. Therefore, it is not surprising that during this period the artist was preoccupied with the biblical theme of Genesis. Particularly, it was the idea of God creating the world out of nothingness that appealed to the artist. Newman strived to create in this manner, to produce out of a void and fight through a primordial sense of chaos. In this case, the theme of Genesis can also extend to the subject of the painting. The title suggests the painting represents the moment of creation. Another possibility is that the title refers to the artwork itself, to the unique moment where all the elements come together to achieve a complete artwork.

This is an early example that demonstrates a significant step in the development of his signature style. Several parallels can be drawn between [i]Moment[/i] and Newman’s artistic breakthrough, the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/onement-i-1948#!#filterName:Series_the-stations-of-the-cross-lema-sabachthani,resultType:masonry][i]Onement I[/i][/url] (1948). The two paintings share the basic structure of a color field with a vertical line cutting through the center of the canvas. The first significant difference between the paintings is in the treatment of the color field. In [i]Onement I[/i] and later paintings, Newman was known for his flat, single tone color fields. This set him apart from other abstract expressionists, such as [url href=Mark Rothko]Mark Rothko[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/clyfford-still]Clyfford Still[/url],  that used more expressive brushstrokes and incorporated several hues into their color fields. In [i]Moment[/i], the artist’s brush strokes are fluid streaks of green and brown tones, which create a wooden like texture. Newman had an affinity toward shades of green and brown. He and other [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism#!#resultType:masonry]abstract expressionists[/url] favored these colors because they believed these were more representative of ‘primitive’ cultures - civilizations that they felt had a more genuine connection to the world.

The second important element in the painting is the vertical streak. In contrast to the color field, the vertical band is painted in a solid light shade of yellow. For Newman, the significance of [i]Onement I[/i] was the creation of the zip, the vertical streak that runs down the length of the canvas. Newman felt that the vibrating zip did not divide the canvas, but instead created unity and harmony. Perhaps for this reason, the artist did not consider the vertical in [i]Moment[/i] to be as successful. The hard edge and sterility of the vertical band splits the canvas, and it almost serves as a partition. [i]Moment[/i] symbolizes an intermediate stage between Newman’s early paintings and his mature style that came about after the painting of [i]Onement I[/i].

In December of 1948, Newman gave [i]Moment[/i] to his wife, Annalee Newman, who presented it to the Tate Museum in 1988. Even though the painting was never exhibited during the artist’s lifetime, it was later displayed in major retrospective exhibitions at the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Modern."
The Wild,Newman Barnett,"Color Field Painting, Minimalism",abstract,"The Wild is unique in Newman's oeuvre by virtue of its unusual size: at eight feet tall by one and a half inches wide, it focuses on the zip alone. When first exhibited it was placed directly across from the vast Vir heroicus sublimis, and was said to be a response to the latter's sprawling size. It demonstrated Newman's belief that a painting need not be physically large to inspire an intense response from the viewer. The Wild could also be regarded as one of the first of the shaped canvases that became popular over a decade later with the arrival of artists such as Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland."
Vir heroicus sublimis,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Translated as ""Man, heroic and sublime,"" Vir heroicus sublimis was, at 95"" by 213"", Newman's largest painting at the time it was completed, although he would go on to create even more expansive works. He intended his audiences to view this and other large paintings from a close vantage point, allowing the colors and zips to fully surround them. In this piece, which is more complex than it initially appears, Newman's zips are variously solid or wavering, creating a perfect square in the center and asymmetrical spaces on the perimeter. Mel Bochner, an artist associated with Conceptualism, remembered encountering it at MOMA in the late 1960s and realising that its scale and color created a new kind of contact between art and the viewer. ""A woman standing there [looking at it].. was covered with red,"" he recalled. ""I realised it was the light shining on the painting reflecting back, filling the space between the viewer and the artwork that created the space, the place. And that that reflection of the self of the painting, the painting as the subject reflected on the viewer, was a wholly new category of experience."""
The Station of the Cross - First Station,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"[url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-stations-of-the-cross-lema-sabachthani,resultType:masonry][i]Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani[/i][/url] is a series of 14 black and white paintings that many consider to be the pinnacle of Barnett Newman’s artistic achievement. Initially, when Newman completed the first two canvases, he knew that he wanted to further develop the theme and create more similar paintings. Only after creating the fourth painting in 1961, Newman came to realize the subject and the layout of the series. The subject of [i]Stations of the Cross[/i] refers to imagery that depicts Jesus Christ on the day of the crucifixion. There is a long and rich artistic tradition of depicting the Passion of Christ, including masterpieces painted by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giotto]Giotto[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/raphael]Raphael[/url]. The first visual representations of the 14 stations began after the pilgrims returned home from the crusades. However, the Church did not formally determine the number and specific content of the stations until the 18th century.  For Newman, the progression of the paintings was crucial, because it expressed continuous agony and suffering. The artist specifically selected the phrase, [i]Lema Sabachthani[/i] (why have you forsaken me?). It is the question that has no answer, and therefore, it is the essence of the Passion of Christ. This question relates back to Abraham and even Adam, it is the original question. The question ‘why’ is the unanswerable question of human suffering.

Because of Newman’s Jewish heritage and his interest in different aspects of Jewish tradition, the series is often linked to the memory of the Holocaust. At the time, there was an established precedent for using the crucifixion as a metaphor for Jewish suffering under Nazism. For instance, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/marc-chagall]Marc Chagall[/url]’s painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/marc-chagall/white-crucifixion-1938][i]White Crucifixion[/i][/url] (1938) uses the image of Jesus on the cross to emphasize the suffering of the Jewish people. Chagall covers the figure of Jesus with the [i]tallit[/i], a traditional garment worn by religious Jews, while the backdrop shows scenes of violence and persecution, such as the burning of a synagogue. Although Newman never mentioned the Holocaust in the context of the series, he did reiterate that new content should be presented in relation to the story of Jesus. For Newman’s generation, the Holocaust, the dropping of the atomic bomb and the Vietnam War were contemporary manifestations of human suffering.

The series was exhibited for the first time in 1966 at the Guggenheim Museum. The installation arranged the paintings in a chronological sequence and included an additional painting, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/be-ii-1964][i]Be II[/i][/url] (1961-1964) at the end of the series. The painting [i]First Station[/i] (1958) was the initial inspiration that drove the creation of the series. Newman’s approach is notably minimalistic, the color field is raw canvas, which is only offset by two vertical bands. Another interesting element in the painting is the treatment of the zip. Here, the process is opposite to the original zip painted in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/onement-i-1948][i]Onement I[/i][/url] (1948), in which the artist painted over a vertical piece of tape. The artist paints in expressive brush strokes around the tape and then pulls the tape down to expose a hard edged zip. The two band structure established in [i]First Station[/i] repeats itself in different proportions and variations throughout the rest of the paintings. The progression and cohesion gives the paintings a sense of completion and balance. In the context of the story of Jesus, this alludes to the ultimate revival and rebirth of Christ, and the overall ability to transcend suffering."
The Station of the Cross - Third Station,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Third Station is part of Newman's major fourteen-piece series, The Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani (1958-66). The title refers to Christ's cry on the cross, yet he also intended to evoke the cries of humanity throughout history. The series is characterized by a stark palette of black, white, and raw canvas - Newman wanted the unpainted canvas to become its own color - and the picture expands the artist's use of the zip, with some appearing starkly straight and others seeming feathered and about to explode. The series took eight years to complete because, as Newman said, he could never plan a picture: ""I could not do them all at once, automatically, one after the other.. When there was a spontaneous urge to do [each of the paintings] is when I did them."""
Canto VII,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"In addition to paintings, Newman also created etchings and lithographs, such as the series 18 Cantos (1963-64). The Cantos are his only print series executed in color, and Newman spoke of them using musical analogies: ""their symphonic mass lends additional clarity to each individual canto,"" he wrote in an introduction to the series, ""and at the same time, each canto adds its song to the full chorus."" In 18 Cantos, Newman employs a wide, off-set band, a variation on the thinner zips, and allows the colors to bleed out into the margins, testing the idea of spatial boundaries. He has written that each canto has its own ""personal margins."""
Canto I,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Here are the cantos, eighteen of them, each one different in form, mood, color, beat, scale, and key. There are no cadenzas. Each is separate. Each can stand by itself. But its fullest meaning it seems to me, is when it is seen together with the others.

Title Page from 18 Cantos,Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Here are the cantos, eighteen of them, each one different in form, mood, color, beat, scale, and key. There are no cadenzas. Each is separate. Each can stand by itself. But its fullest meaning it seems to me, is when it is seen together with the others.
—Barnett Newman, ""Preface to 18 Cantos,"" 1964"
Broken Obelisk,Newman Barnett,Minimalism,sculpture,"Even though Barnett Newman is principally known for his paintings, one of his most acclaimed artworks is the monumental sculpture [i]Broken Obelisk[/i] (1963-1967). The sculpture encompasses the ideas that Newman dealt with throughout his career, mainly the pursuit and expression of ‘the sublime’. The meaning of the sculpture relates to broader concepts associated with the World-War II generation. The artists of this generation witnessed some of the greatest atrocities and instances of human destruction, such as the Holocaust and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At the same time, there was sense that in living through these circumstances, life had triumphed over death, and the human spirit had triumphed over suffering.

Newman and his contemporaries created art that responded to the experiences of the 1940s, and their artworks often symbolized death, survival and rebirth. In Newman’s case, [i]Broken Obelisk[/i] expresses these ideas in a concise and complete way, but these ideas can also be found in other artworks. For example, his series [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-stations-of-the-cross-lema-sabachthani,resultType:masonry][i]Stations of the Cross: Lema Sabachthani[/i][/url] (1958-1966) references the agony of Jesus and the crucifixion. Newman translates the religious content of death and rebirth to the secular world. The progression of the series of paintings, expresses the ability to transcend suffering through the process of self-awareness.

The sculpture is influenced by ancient Egyptian monuments. Although the artist uses ancient language, the sculpture manages to attain a modern spirit. At the base of the sculpture is a pyramid, and from the top of the pyramid ascends an inverted obelisk. The sculpture has a dramatic visual impact, as it seems to defy the laws of physics. Newman achieved this by placing a hidden steel rod at the body of the sculpture that stabilized the structure. The pyramids of ancient Egypt were symbols of death since they were tombs for the pharaohs and their spouses. The obelisk symbolized the sun god Ra, and the tall column can be interpreted as materialization of a sun ray. The pairing creates a contrast between the obelisk, a symbol of infinite energy and sunlight, and the pyramid, a symbol of death. The obelisk bursts out of the pyramid, creating a visual representation of hope and light transcending death.

Newman stated that when he created the [i]Broken Obelisk[/i], he had no particular location in mind. In total, the sculpture was fabricated four times, three times during the artist’s lifetime, and once after his death. One of the versions is part the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Another is displayed in the Red Square at Washington University in Seattle. A third version is installed in front of the Rothko Chapel in Houston and is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King. The final version was completed in 2006, and purchased by the Storm King Art Center in New Windsor, New York. In four different contexts, there is potential to give the sculpture new interpretations that might even go beyond the artist’s original intentions."
"Who’s Afraid of Red,  Yellow and Blue II",Newman Barnett,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Barnett Newman’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/all-works#!#filterName:Series_who-s-afraid-of-red-yellow-and-blue-1969-1970,resultType:masonry]series[/url], [i]Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue?[/i] (1966-1970) exemplifies the emancipation of color. In this case, the color is the subject, it does not represent anything, it only expresses itself. The series consists of four large scale paintings tied together through the use of primary colors. The title, that references Edward Albee’s play, [i]Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf[/i], further reinforces the color as the subject matter. The title also relates to the idea of fear. The paintings are almost intimidating due to their overwhelming size (the largest canvas measures at 274x603 cm) and bold application of color. This is additionally amplified by the bright red color fields that dominate the canvases.

In the series, Newman opened a dialogue with both the older and the younger generation of abstract painters. In his use of primary colors he challenged the ideas of his predecessors, the representatives of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/de-stijl-neoplasticism#!#resultType:masonry]Neoplasticism[/url], particularly [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url]. Mondrian reduced all elements in nature to verticals, horizontals and a palette of primary colors. Through this form of abstraction, Mondrian believed that his paintings displayed the physical world in its essential form. Newman often criticized this approach for being absolute and systematic. Specifically, in terms of color he felt that it limited the artist to a predetermined color system. Newman’s approach to color was more intuitive, and was not limited in terms of color tones. Newman used a single primary color in some paintings, such as the red color field in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman/vir-heroicus-sublimis-1951][i]Vic Heroicus Sublimis[/i][/url] (1950-1951). However, like many [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism#!#resultType:masonry]abstract expressionists[/url], he did not combine all three primary colors in a single painting prior to the 1960s. Through the series [i]Who’s Afraid[/i], Newman answered the question posed in the title. He embraces primary colors, but the intention is to emphasize the difference between the two approaches. In Mondrian’s case, the primary colors represent the essence of the elements in the natural world. By contrast, Newman applies the paint in order to showcase and express the qualities of the color itself.

In that stage of his career, Newman was a veteran abstract expressionist that influenced a younger generation of painters. At the same time, he was also aware of new approaches and trends developed by the new generation. Younger artists, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/frank-stella]Frank Stella[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/ellsworth-kelly]Ellsworth Kelly[/url] had a straightforward approach to color, they applied paint to the canvas directly without mixing them. In some instances, the colors had a superficial quality, which lacked the spiritual and emotional impact expressed in Newman’s color field paintings. However, there is one element where Newman was possibly influenced by the younger generation. The title was always an important element in Newman’s art, but he rarely referenced colors in his titles. This was common among artists like Ellsworth Kelly. It is possible that in emulating this, Newman wanted to show that he was aware of the latest trends in art. By engaging with his predecessors and his successors, Newman clarified his own position, ideas and artistic identity. Given the late stage of his career, it is plausible that Newman viewed [i]Who’s Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue?[/i] as an opportunity to reaffirm his legacy and place in art history."
Entrance to Subway,Rothko Mark,Expressionism,genre painting,"[i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] (1938) is one of Mark Rothko’s paintings that depicts scenes of the New York subway. Although Rothko never purposefully created a series of subway paintings, this was a recurring theme in his early works. Rothko moved to New York in 1923 after giving up his studies at Yale University. In New York, he attended classes at the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/art-students-league#!#resultType:masonry]Art Students League[/url]. Several years later, Rothko met the modernist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/milton-avery]Milton Avery[/url], who had a profound impact on his early artistic development, particularly on the application and treatment of color. Additionally, the slightly elongated figures in [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] are reminiscent of Avery’s figures in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/milton-avery/artist-s-wife-1930][i]Artist’s Wife[/i][/url] (1930).

[i]Entrance to the Subway[/i], along with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/untitled-subway-1937][i]Untitled (Subway)[/i][/url] (ca.1937) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/underground-fantasy][i]Underground Fantasy[/i][/url] (1940), shows the alienation of city life. It is similar to the atmosphere [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper]Edward Hopper[/url] projected in paintings [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper/automat-1927][i]Automat[/i][/url] (1927) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-hopper/chop-suey-1929][i]Chop Suey[/i][/url] (1929) that expressed the same kind of urban loneliness and isolation. Rothko admired Hopper and even painted [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/composition-i-1931][i]Composition I[/i][/url] (1931) as an homage to Hopper. 

Though paintings like [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] are related to Depression-era realist paintings, the similarity mainly stems from the common subject matter of urban life. Generally, Rothko rejected the principles of realist painting, whether it was [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/social-realism]Social Realism[/url] or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/regionalism]American Regionalism[/url]. In fact, in 1935, Rothko co-founded the art group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/the-ten]The Ten[/url], whose members included artists [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/willem-de-kooning]Willem de Kooning[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-baziotes]William Baziotes[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/adolph-gottlieb]Adolph Gottlieb[/url]. In 1938, the group held an exhibition called [i]The Ten Whitney Dissenters[/i], vocalizing their dissatisfaction with the Whitney Museum of American Art. The artists condemned the Museum policy of supporting realist styles. Thus, Rothko and his colleagues positioned themselves as revolutionary outcasts, showing disdain for the art establishment as well as for the socialist realist left orthodoxy.

In this period, Rothko chose to paint in an expressionist style, which suited his artistic approach. He was not interested in the realism of city life; rather, he wanted to express the emotional perception of the urban environment. [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] has a dark and haunting atmosphere. While the viewer can recognize the human figures as commuters and subway workers, for the most part, they remain faceless, emphasizing the feeling of isolation and alienation. In the monotonous routine of daily life, the individual can only identify people superficially but cannot make a meaningful or lasting connection.
Even though stylistically [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i] is very different from the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/color-field-painting#!#filterName:all-works,viewType:masonry]color-field[/url] paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/cat-newyork][i]Yellow, Charcoal, Brown[/i][/url] (1953) Rothko is known for, this early work hints at his future artistic development. In [i]Entrance to the Subway[/i], Rothko demonstrated sophisticated use of color that will later become a focal point in his work."
Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea,Rothko Mark,Surrealism,abstract,"[i]Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea[/i] (1944) is representative of Rothko’s Surrealist period that lasted roughly from 1936 to 1948. This artwork also has a personal dimension,  as Rothko painted it shortly after meeting his soon to be second wife, Mary Ellen “Mell” Beistle. According to their son, the painting hung in the living room of their brownstone in New York. The image depicts two creatures, possibly Rothko and Mell, sitting side by side, between the sea and the sky.  Like Surrealists before him, Rothko found inspiration in the realm of his unconsciousness. His surrealist period lasted throughout World War II. In his paintings, he escaped from the terrors of contemporary life and sought to return to primal beginnings of the essential sources of life, myth, and art. In prior decades, these ideas preoccupied Surrealist artists, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro]Joan Miró[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/the-birth-of-the-world][i]The Birth of the World[/i][/url], who attempted to recreate the mythic and biological origins of the universe.

[i]Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea[/i] shares common elements with Miró’s [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/the-family-1924][i]The Family[/i][/url] (1924). Both have fragments of eyes, birds, and amorphous shapes swirling in the background. These fragments and forms bring to mind archeological artifacts excavated from ancient civilizations that developed in Mesopotamia, Greece, Mexico, and the Northeast Pacific. This resemblance is not coincidental; during the 1930s and the 1940s, there were exhibitions of indigenous art held at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York. The totemic figures in [i]Slow Swirl[/i] could have been inspired by the figures of the Sky Father and Earth Mother in Navajo sand paintings that were exhibited in the 1941 MOMA exhibition “Indian Art of the United States.”

Another important source of influence was French Surrealist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andre-masson]André Masson[/url]. There is a particular connection between [i]Slow Swirl[/i] and Masson’s drawing [i]Unity of the Cosmos[/i] (1943) from his book [i]Anatomy of the Universe[/i]. Masson’s illustration depicts an imaginary species of hybrids that are mixtures of a mechanic, human, insect, plant elements. In [i]Slow Swirl[/i], Rothko echoes some of the shapes and the style of Masson’s imaginary beings. Like Masson, Rothko examines the origin of the universe and conjures images of the [i]Book of Genesis[/i]. However, Rothko himself explained that there was no clear association to any specific visual experiences, although they do embody the principle and passion of organisms. Therefore, two figures at the edge of the sea can be associated with Adam and Eve, but in a universal sense, as the very principals of male and female organisms. 

Rothko’s undergraduate studies in natural sciences at Yale University were also significant. Scholars have pointed out the connection between Rothko’s surrealist imagery and diagrams of geological stratification found in undergraduate textbooks. Another essential element of [i]Slow Swirl[/i] is a sense of transparency that would become central in his later works. Therefore, not only [i]Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea[/i] is representative of Rothko’s Surrealist period, but it also is a prefiguration of his future works."
Multiform,Rothko Mark,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"[i]Multiform[/i] (1948) belongs to a group of paintings by Mark Rothko, which signifies the transition toward his mature abstract style. These paintings, collectively known as 'Multiforms', were painted between 1947 and 1949. The artist did not officially use the name 'Multiforms'; the term was adopted by art critics and historians to describe the group of paintings. In the specific case of [i]Multiform[/i], it seems the title was only used after Rothko's death in 1970. It first appeared in the catalog for the Rothko exhibition held at the 1970 Venice Biennale. The catalog was put together by the staff of the Marlborough Gallery, who adopted the term 'Multiforms', claiming it was casually used by Rothko to describe this group of artworks.

Paintings such as [i]Multiform[/i] demonstrate a transitional phase in Rothko's artistic development: the artist moved on from [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/surrealism]Surrealist[/url] imagery that inspired paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/rites-of-lilith][i]Rites of Lilith[/i][/url] (1945) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/tentacles-of-memory][i]Tentacles of Memory[/i][/url] (1946).  At the same time, the abstract style of [i]Multiform[/i] foresees later color field paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/untitled-purple-white-and-red-1953][i]Untitled (Purple, White, and Red)[/i][/url] (1953). 

The term [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/color-field-painting]color field painting[/url] originally described a tendency in the works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionist[/url] painters in the 1950s, mainly Mark Rothko, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barnett-newman]Barnett Newman[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/clyfford-still]Clyfford Still[/url]. Like the term suggests, the style's features were large flat planes of solid colors. In [i]Multiform[/i], the artist created a composite of colorful free form shapes, which blur together on the canvas. Rothko combined bright tones of blue, turquoise, and orange, with darker red browns. Some of these colors stand out because of their hue and brightness, while others fade into the background. However, the multitude of colors and shapes makes it hard to sufficiently distinguish between the figures and background. Around the edges of the canvas, there are three large rectangular blocks of muted colors. These rectangular surfaces would become the dominant motif of later compositions like the abovementioned [i]Untitled (Purple, White and Red)[/i]. Even though Rothko's [i]Multiform[/i] lacks the sophistication and succinctness of later color field paintings, it is an example of the artist's complete withdrawal from figurative painting. He came to believe that the painted figure could not adequately express the world's essential and universal qualities. In [i]Multiform[/i], he experimented with fluid forms to create gestures that humans could not make. Ultimately, Rothko found these forms unsatisfactory, but they helped the artist to embrace abstraction.

Around the time he created [i][/i]Multiform, Rothko worked on other important projects. In 1948, he and his colleagues [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-baziotes]William Baziotes[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-hare]David Hare[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-motherwell]Robert Motherwell[/url], co-founded the New York school [i]The Subject of the Artists[/i]. The unique curriculum gave the students the opportunity to associate with working artists and use their guidance to develop different artistic processes. Although the school was short-lived, it served as an essential hub of activity in contemporary art. In addition to teaching, Rothko also made theoretical contributions by writing texts for art magazines [i]Tiger's Eye[/i] and [i]Possibilities[/i]. The combination of activities that occupied Rothko during his Multiforms phase shows this was a formative period in which he developed his artistic style and philosophy."
"No.3/No.13 (Magenta, Black, Green on Orange)",Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Magenta, Black, Green on Orange follows a compositional structure that Rothko explored for twenty–three years beginning in 1947. Narrowly separated, rectangular blocks of color hover in a column against a colored ground. Their edges are soft and irregular, so that when Rothko uses closely related tones, the rectangles sometimes seem barely to coalesce out of the ground, concentrations of its substance. The green bar in Magenta, Black, Green on Orange, on the other hand, appears to vibrate against the orange around it, creating an optical flicker. In fact the canvas is full of gentle movement, as blocks emerge and recede, and surfaces breathe. Just as edges tend to fade and blur, colors are never completely flat, and the faint unevenness in their intensity, besides hinting at the artist's process in layering wash on wash, mobilizes an ambiguity, a shifting between solidity and impalpable depth.

The sense of boundlessness in Rothko's paintings has been related to the aesthetics of the sublime, an implicit or explicit concern of a number of his fellow painters in the New York School. In fact, the remarkable color in his paintings was for him only a means to a larger end: ""I'm interested only in expressing basic human emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom,"" he said. ""If you... are moved only by... color relationships, then you miss the point."""
No.5/No.22,Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"The rectangles within this painting do not extend to the edges of the canvas and appear to hover just over its surface. Heightening this sensation is the effect of chromatic afterimage. Staring at each colored segment individually affects the perception of those adjacent to it. The red–orange center of the painting tints the yellow above it with just a bit of green. The yellow above seems to tint the orange with blue. Despite these color relationships, Rothko did not want his pictures appreciated solely for their spectral qualities. He said, ""If you are only moved by color relationships, then you miss the point. I'm interested in expressing the big emotions—tragedy, ecstasy, doom."""
"White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose)",Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"The work was sold in May 2007 by Sotheby's on behalf of David Rockefeller to the Royal family of Qatar; Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and his wife, Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned. The painting sold for 72.84 million (USD), setting the record of the current most expensive post-war work of art sold at auction. White Center is part of Rothko's signature multiform style: several blocks of layered, complementary colors on a large canvas. The painting is from top to bottom, a yellow horizontal rectangle, a black horizontal strip, a narrow white rectangular band and the bottom half is lavender. The top half of the rose ground is deeper in colour and the bottom half is pale. It measures 205.8 × 141 cm."
No. 2 (No. 7 and No. 2),Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Now applied in thin washes (often composed of both oil and egg-based media), Rothko's color achieved a new luminosity. The artist's technique appears simple, but on close examination is richly varied in its range of effects. At times, paint can be seen running upward across the surface; this is because Rothko often inverted a picture while working on it, sometimes changing the final orientation at a late stage."
No.61 (Rust and Blue),Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"The work was first exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1961. In common with Rothko's other works from this period, No 61 consists of large expanses of colour delineated by uneven, hazy shades."
Orange and Yellow,Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Orange and Yellow reflects Mark Rothko’s mature style, in which two or three rectangles are set within a background that surrounds them all, but divides them gently from one another. The edges of the rectangles are never distinct, avoiding an optical break and allowing viewers’ eyes to move quietly from other area to another in a contemplative way.

Rothko did not want us to think about him when looking at his paintings, so he tried to remove all evidence of the creation process. To accomplish this, he applied numerous layers of thin paint with a brush or rag to unprepared canvas, which absorbed the colors into its fabric. The many thin washes help to give his paintings a lightness and brightness, as if they glow from within.

Orange and Yellow was considered quite large in the 1950s, and Rothko asked viewers to stand close in order to be visually surrounded by the colors."
Light Red Over Black,Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"The large oil painting, [i]Light Red Over Black[/i] (1957) (230x152 cm), is an example of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/color-field-painting]color field paintings[/url] created by Mark Rothko in the 1950s. The painting was part of the US Pavilion at the 29th Venice Biennale in 1958 and was acquired the following year by the Tate Museum in London. Earlier color field paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/white-center][i]White Center (Yellow, Pink, and Lavender on Rose)[/i][/url] (1950) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/no-5-no-22][i]No.5/No.22[/i][/url] (1949-1950) are recognizable by the artist’s use of bright and vibrant colors. However, from the second half of the 1950s, his palette darkened, and the paintings became more muted and somber. In these darker works like [i]Light Red Over Black[/i], Rothko explored the interplay between light and depth.

[i]Light Red Over Black[/i] was created on a single sheet of tightly stretched cotton duck canvas. According to his son, Christopher Rothko, the artist would often prop up the canvas on blocks, and then climb a ladder to paint the canvas. Initially, Rothko primed the canvas with a coat base of red that mixed powder pigments with rabbit skin glue. This treatment would give the painting a greater illusion of depth.  The second layer was purposefully a thin coat of paint. Sometimes, Rothko would paint thin coats of multiple colors to allow these different tones to shine through subtly. After that, Rothko began painting the rectangles, by once again layering different colors. In [i]Light Red Over Black[/i], the two black rectangles have a base of blues and blacks that create hazy forms and give the canvas a greater sense of depth and dynamism. The areas of black paint were sparsely applied, leaving a vivid scarlet blue border, which stands out against the red background. The top rectangle was densely painted, while the bottom rectangle the paint was applied thinly and loosely, allowing some of the red to show through. Rothko softened the rectangle edges, leaving visible traces of his brushwork and emphasizing the painterly quality of [i]Light Red Over Black[/i]. Even though it appears Rothko painted at a rapid pace, he would take time between the different stages of the painting to look at the canvas and contemplate the composition and overall appearance of the painting.

In his paintings, Rothko wanted to express human emotions as well as the essential and universal characteristics of the natural world. Here Rothko kept with the tradition of 19th-century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism]Romantic[/url] painters [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/william-turner]J.M.W Turner[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/caspar-david-friedrich]Caspar David Friedrich[/url], who strived to express these ideas by painting awe-inspiring landscapes. However, Rothko and other [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionists[/url] abandoned figurative painting because they felt it could not adequately express the spiritual and the emotional essence of the world. Although his abstract paintings were compared to works of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/de-stijl-neoplasticism]Neoplasticist[/url] artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian]Piet Mondrian[/url], Rothko’s abstraction took it a step further. Mondrian’s abstract paintings have a reference in the natural world, while Rothko’s paintings were not tied to any particular optical phenomena. Rothko wanted the viewer to meditate and explore his large canvases, to come close to the painting and become enveloped in it. For Rothko, his color combination and composition were a way of communicating human emotion and echoing the human experience to the viewer."
Untitled (Blue Divided by Blue),Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"Untitled (Blue Divided by Blue) from 1966 is a rare painting by Mark Rothko, believed to be one of only four recorded works on paper from this year (in this case the paper is mounted on canvas). Until 1970, Rothko has been preoccupied exploring the limits of painting on paper. In a period of depression, Blue Divided by Blue is arguably one of his most serene-looking paintings."
Rothko Chapel,Rothko Mark,Minimalism,installation,"The Rothko Chapel is a non-denominational chapel in Houston, Texas founded by John and Dominique de Menil and opened in 1971. The interior serves not only as a chapel, but also as a major work of modern art. On its walls are fourteen black but color hued paintings by Mark Rothko. The shape of the building, an octagon inscribed in a Greek cross, and the design of the chapel was largely influenced by the artist.

Susan J. Barnes states ""The Rothko Chapel...became the world's first broadly ecumenical center, a holy place open to all religions and belonging to none. It became a center for international cultural, religious, and philosophical exchanges, for colloquia and performances. And it became a place of private prayer for individuals of all faiths"".

Fourteen of Rothko's paintings are displayed in the chapel. Three walls display triptychs, while the other five walls display single paintings. Beginning in 1964, Rothko began painting a series of black paintings, which incorporated other dark hues and texture effects. A typical question raised by visitors viewing the massive black canvases which adorn the walls of the chapel includes some variant of: ""Where are the paintings?"" The hue of the paintings vary on the lightning of the moment of the day.

The de Menils offered Rothko a commission for the chapel in 1964. From the fall of 1964 through the spring of 1967, he painted the fourteen large paintings and four alternates, which incorporated many of the characteristics of the earlier 1964 black paintings.

In front of the chapel lies Barnett Newman's sculpture Broken Obelisk."
Untitled (Black and Gray),Rothko Mark,Color Field Painting,abstract,"[i]Untitled (Black and Gray)[/i] is one of the last paintings produced by Mark Rothko before he committed suicide on February 25th, 1970. The painting belongs to Rothko’s final series, which contained color-field paintings of black and grey, black and brown. Rothko demonstrated variation throughout the series by playing with color tones and scale, in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/untitled-brown-and-gray][i]Untitled (Brown and Gray)[/i][/url] (1969).

Many have interpreted the series, and notably [i]Untitled (Black and Gray)[/i] as a sign of Rothko’s mental and physical diminishment. Indeed, when he was asked what the series was about, he plainly explained that it was about death. Even though he already gained success and recognition, Rothko’s last years proved strenuous. He was recovering from an aortic aneurysm, and his physical state was quickly deteriorating. It also had a significant impact on his mental state, leading to a struggle with depression. Based on accounts and conversations with friends and colleagues, the artist was worried about his legacy; he felt misunderstood and wanted to leave a lasting mark in his art. This sense of urgency was reflected in his last paintings: they were made at a rapid pace with quick strokes that generated a powerful visual impact. Because of the dark theme, some view Rothko’s last paintings as a sign of his abandonment of spirituality and meaning. However, in these paintings, he confronted the inevitable outcome of death and dealt with the temporal nature of life. The artist experimented with his brushwork and technique in an attempt to find an essential form of expression through which he could communicate his ideas to the viewer. While death was undeniably on his mind, it is essential to note that parallel to this series Rothko also produced a softer range of paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/untitled-gray-and-mauve-1969][i]Untitled (Gray and Mauve)[/i][/url] (1969). 

In the horizontal composition of [i]Untitled (Black and Gray)[/i], Rothko blurred the ‘horizon’ line by blending the two colors. Rothko’s blurred horizon can be associated with similar effects applied in landscape paintings. The color combination of black and gray can provoke an image of nightfall setting on a desolate landscape - a metaphor for death. The second significant feature of [i]Untitled (Black and Gray)[/i] is the white margin that frames the image. The artist placed masking tape before beginning to paint and removed it at the end to create a crisp edge. For Rothko, the outside margin was as crucial as the central motif. The clean white margin provided a contrast to the free and expressive brushwork of the black and gray color fields. The margin also gives the color field clear definition and enhances the flat quality of the painting. In earlier works, Rothko used a mixture of rabbit skin glue and pigment in his first layer of color, which gave the color and painting a greater illusion of depth. However, in this series, he primed the canvas with white gesso that contributed to the lack of pictorial depth."
Seated Woman,de Kooning Willem,Expressionism,portrait,"'Seated Woman' originated from a portrait commission and features Elaine Fried, who frequently modeled for de Kooning at the time. Her auburn-colored hair is visible in the painting, where she is portrayed wearing a low-cut yellow dress and seated on a chair with one leg crossed over the other. One of her arms rests in her lap, while the other seems to bend towards her face, but without a hand attached. Curator John Elderfield notes that her body parts appear more like disconnected shapes that float around her body. De Kooning explained in the 1950s that he reduced body parts to interchangeable shapes, like spots of paint or brushstrokes, due to the challenges he faced in painting them.

The painting reveals de Kooning's artistic influences, such as the fractured form of the figure reminiscent of Picasso and the erasures and unfinished quality similar to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/arshile-gorky/the-artist-with-his-mother-1936]Arshile Gorky's 'The Artist and his Mother'[/url]. The background, scraped down multiple times to create a smooth surface, contains oranges, greens, and blues that hint at Cubist space and Mondrian's Neo-Plastic paintings. The squares in the painting also suggest the artist's studio walls, covered with various canvases tacked and piled against them. Seated Woman can be viewed as a companion piece to a series of paintings of seated men, and it marked de Kooning's first significant painting of a woman, a subject he would frequently return to over the years."
Pink Angels,de Kooning Willem,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"'Pink Angels' features pink- and coral-colored, biomorphic shapes that float above a background of mustard yellows and golds, representing an important stage in de Kooning's transition from figuration to abstraction in the late 1940s. The fleshy pink shapes suggest anatomical forms that have been ripped apart or are in the process of colliding, perhaps influenced by the trauma of World War II. Curator John Elderfield notes that the painting also shows connections to the works of Picasso, Miró, Matisse, and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, especially [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937]Picasso's 'Guernica'[/url].

What sets de Kooning's approach apart is his resistance to hiding the process of the painting's creation. Charcoal lines outline the pink forms and intersect the golden areas, and discernible shapes like an eye and a fish head in the bottom left corner, a circle and rectangle in the bottom center, and a crab-like form in the bottom right are visible. De Kooning used tracings to position and rearrange shapes on the canvas, allowing for fluid construction and reconstruction of his compositions. This method gives his works a sense of spontaneity despite the careful planning and manipulation behind the scenes. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who claimed to work spontaneously without sketches, de Kooning's technique results in complex layering and sudden, shifting dissonances on the painting's surface."
Untitled,de Kooning Willem,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"At the Charlie Egan Gallery in the spring of 1948, De Kooning held his first solo exhibition at the age of forty-four. The majority of the paintings on display were Untitled compositions that featured vaguely recognizable shapes and intricate interplays of figure and ground, all painted in black and white. Although the exhibition did not receive much attention from the press, it had a significant impact on the downtown art scene, both on seasoned artists and newcomers. De Kooning's use of stark black and white color scheme, coupled with his manipulation of surface and depth, resulted in a dynamic composition that appeared to be on the verge of disintegration.

While the viewer might discern elements such as a haunch or a penis, the white lines that De Kooning drew on the surface also had a calligraphic quality to them, reminiscent of his time as a sign painter. At the time, the Abstract Expressionists were interested in symbols and ideographs, and how paintings could convey a universal human emotion or experience. Harold Rosenberg, De Kooning's friend, described these paintings as ""symbolist abstraction dissociated from their sources in nature[;] organic shapes are carriers of emotional charges in the same category as numbers, mathematical signs, letters of the alphabet; the memory of a friend may be aroused by a pair of gloves or a telephone number, an erotic memory by a curved line or an initial."" The shapes and signs in De Kooning's paintings created a mysterious drama that was constantly shifting, necessitating the viewer to constantly adjust and see anew."
Excavation,de Kooning Willem,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In the late 1940s, even as De Kooning returned to figuration, he embarked on creating another abstraction, Excavation. While not as monumental as some later Abstract Expressionist paintings, the canvas was the biggest painting he had ever made, measuring just over six-and-a-half-feet tall and eight-feet wide. The pictorial space depicted in the painting was closely tied to De Kooning's sense of space in the physical world. As he explained in a talk he wrote for the Artists' Club, ""If I stretch my arms next to the rest of myself and wonder where my fingers are - that is all the space I need as a painter."" In essence, his canvases were born at the fullest extension of his arms, where his fingers held the brush that touched the canvas. To go beyond this scale would risk losing the human intimacy of the space.

Most of the canvas is covered in shapes of dirty white, cream, and yellow, outlined with black and gray lines. Throughout the canvas, there are passages of various colors, such as crimson, blue, magenta, gold, and aqua. This results in an all-over composition with no specific point of entry, causing the viewer's eyes to move across the entire canvas. No single section stands out as more or less interesting than another. However, one can discern a ground line at the bottom edge of the painting and a rectangle that resembles a door or window. While the composition seems to extend beyond the edges of the canvas, De Kooning brings the viewer back to a threshold, suggesting a particular place and time, grounding them in the present. Harold Rosenberg described the painting as ""a classical painting, majestic and distant, like a formula wrung out of testing explosives,"" suggesting that it was a masterpiece that De Kooning had worked his way into and closed the door behind him."
Woman I,de Kooning Willem,Abstract Expressionism,portrait,"'Woman I' is part of the 'Women' series that de Kooning presented at the Sidney Janis Gallery, causing controversy in the art world. The canvas is covered with vigorous, creamy, and silvery hues in a frenzy of vertical and horizontal gestures, from which a wide-eyed, large-breasted woman emerges, with blonde hair and a big smile. The figure appears constrained yet full of energy, and her tapering towards the knees and ankles is similar to prehistoric figurines and Cycladic idols, both examples of the importance of the female form in the art to which de Kooning often referred. De Kooning merges the figure and ground together, blurring the distinction between them, and creating an effect he called ""no-environment."" In the Women paintings from the early 1950s, we can see how de Kooning will later merge body and landscape in his paintings.

De Kooning frequently returned to the theme of women, and some believed that his turbulent relationship with his wife, his estrangement from his mother, and his infidelity was the source of this subject. The artist was accused of hating women, as he used smears of red paint to create three bullet holes across the woman's chest, but de Kooning responded by saying, ""I thought it was rubies."" Elaine de Kooning clarified that the bullet holes were actually fashionable rubies that de Kooning saw in a Harper's Bazaar magazine and never forgot.

Critics projected their own anxieties and misogynist tendencies onto de Kooning's work, failing to recognize his engagement with and incorporation of popular consumer culture in his paintings. De Kooning referred to his women as funny and larger than life, satirizing the shoppers in department stores and the fashionable ladies who walked down Madison Avenue. Although he looked to ancient idols and classical odalisques, he was equally fascinated by pin-up girls and movie stars. De Kooning was one of the few Abstract Expressionists to take on the such subject matter, and his work became an important reference point for younger artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Larry Rivers, Grace Hartigan, and later Pop Artists."
Rosy-Fingered Dawn at Louse Point,de Kooning Willem,Abstract Expressionism,abstract,"In the late 1950s, de Kooning started to spend more time in the rural and peaceful town of East Hampton, in contrast to the bustling city streets of New York. His painting, Rosy-Fingered Dawn at Louse Point, still embodies his signature bold brushstrokes, but the arrangement and color palette are noticeably different. The new palette, which curator John Elderfield describes as ""rococo hues of pink, yellow, and blue,"" is linked to de Kooning's recent trip to Italy. The bright, pastel colors convey a sense of a brighter landscape and the reflection of water. Louse Point, a beach near his new studio, inspired the painting's title, which references Homer's epic The Odyssey. The pink forms also recall de Kooning's various representations of women. Although the painting does not depict any landscape or figure, de Kooning's quote, ""The landscape is in the Woman and there is Woman in the landscape,"" invites us to imagine a connection between them.

The painting's surface is richly textured and varied. Some areas are heavily impastoed, where de Kooning applied thick layers of paint, while other parts are thin and dry, where he pressed newspaper onto the surface to absorb excess oil. Elderfield also notes that the drips of paint run in different directions, indicating that de Kooning worked on the canvas from multiple angles before settling on its final orientation. This adaptability and openness demonstrates de Kooning's spontaneity and his reluctance to commit to a particular form or composition until he felt it was ready."
The City Square,Giacometti Alberto,Expressionism,sculpture,"Giacometti’s scene derives from modern urban experience. He states: “In the street people astound and interest me more than any sculpture or painting. Every second the people stream together and go apart, then they approach each other to get closer to one another. They unceasingly form and re-form living compositions in unbelievable complexity. . . . It’s the totality of this life that I want to reproduce in everything I do. . . .”¹

The Walking Man I,Giacometti Alberto,Expressionism,sculpture,L'Homme Qui Marche I was created at the high point of Giacometti's mature period and represents the pinnacle of his experimentation with the human form. The piece is considered to be one of the most important works by the artist and one of the most iconic images of Modern art.
Méta-Malevitch,Tinguely Jean,Kinetic Art,installation,"In 1954 Tinguely created a group of works for exhibitions in Paris and Milan that are today subsumed under the heading “Méta-Malevitch”. These are reliefs made of square or rectangular wooden boxes in front of which metal elements in basic geometric shapes such as line and circle in pure white (or in a few cases glowing red) seem to float.

These floating forms are mounted on fine wires that are connected behind the “picture surface” with wooden or metal wheels of various sizes. When these wheels are set in motion by drive belts connecting them with a likewise hidden motor, a continual series of new constellations appear on the “picture surface“. Tinguely further enhances the effect thus created by ensuring that the pivot point is not in the middle for all lines and that the wheels have different diameters, making the elements rotate at various speeds. This furthermore prevents simple symmetrical constellations from being produced after a certain amount of time, or, as Tinguely once gushed to a viewer of his works: “It would take at least 10,000 years for this extraordinary new machine to repeat before our eyes the same composition.”"
Méta-Matic No. 14,Tinguely Jean,"Kinetic Art, Nouveau Réalisme",sculpture,"The portable and hand-driven “Méta-Matic No. 14” emphasises the happening aspect even more dramatically than the other drawing machines. Here it becomes particularly obvious that it is the moment of drawing, the interaction between art viewer (art user) and machine sculpture that actually constitutes the artwork, and that the drawing produced in the process is more like a document of a lived interaction than an artwork in its own right."
Homage to New York,Tinguely Jean,"Kinetic Art, Nouveau Réalisme",performance,"Swiss artist Jean Tinguely was best known for his 1960 performance piece entitled Homage to New York. This work involved the self-destruction of a huge sculpture in front of an audience at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In collaboration with other artists/engineers, among them Billy Klüver and Robert Rauschenberg, he produced a self-destroying mechanism that performed for 27 minutes during a public performance for invited guests. In the end, the public browsed the remnants of the machine for souvenirs to take home. The work only partially auto-destructed before the fire department stepped in and put a stop to it all much to the dismay of the crowd.

Pieces of the work were kept as mementos, however the majority of it was thrown away.

This hommage to the energy of a city that keeps rebuilding itself time after time is a wonderful example of the different and sometimes conflicting conceptions of artists and engineers on how machines should work–and as such an early collaborative effort that foreshadowed the events staged by E.A.T.—as well as a document on the 60s with the rise of happening and performance."
Frigo Duchamp,Tinguely Jean,Nouveau Réalisme,sculpture,"In contrast with many other works by Jean Tinguely, we have little information on “Frigo Duchamp”, knowing only that the refrigerator was a gift to him from Marcel Duchamp. The work was executed between autumn 1960 and September 1962, when it was on view in the New York gallery of Sidney Janis. According to the artist, the piece was thereafter stored for twenty years in a friend’s garden, where it presumably remained nearly unchanged over the years."
Le soulier de Madame Lacasse,Tinguely Jean,"Kinetic Art, Nouveau Réalisme",sculpture,"In “Le Soulier de Madame Lacasse“ Tinguely plays pranks with the machine and its mechanics, showing traits not normally connected with them: random and absurd activities. Moreover, he juxtaposes here utterly disparate objects in new relationships and reanimates them by means of violent movements, making them seem alien to the viewer but at the same time drawing his attention to these normally unremarkable things.

Instead of a pedestal, a rusty iron table serves as base. Atop it the artist sets an elaborate construction made of wheels, V-belts and axes, which, driven by an electric motor, moves parts of a motorcycle yawing and clamouring up and down. Tinguely’s “Soulier de Madame Lacasse“ is an anti-machine that wastes its energy on an optical and acoustic spectacle instead of putting it into productive work.

When the motor is switched on, a worn-out shoe that once belonged to Madame Lacasse, the wife of a Belgian artist who, like Tinguely, had his studio in the Impasse Ronsin in Paris, is catapulted through the air accompanied by the deafening noise of the machine. On another long iron wire flaps an ultramarine cardboard panel from Tinguely’s artist friend Yves Klein, who wanted to revolutionise the world with the deep blue colour he had developed."
Baluba,Tinguely Jean,"Kinetic Art, Nouveau Réalisme",sculpture,"In his “Balubas”, executed from autumn 1961 to spring 1963, Tinguely lets a vast abundance of the detritus of civilisation and consumer rubbish perform a wild and provocative dance. Alongside pieces of iron and wire, there are plastic fragments, brightly coloured feathers, rubber bands, furs, toys - banal everyday objects that Tinguely puts together into fragile assemblages. The juxtaposition of numerous individual pieces that were never meant to go together generates a bizarre and irritating effect.

Starting in October 1960, Jean Tinguely lived with artist Niki de Saint Phalle in his studio on Impasse Ronsin. Inspired by her work, he integrated coloured feathers into the “Balubas” that give them an exuberant, high-spirited air. The improvisational look of the structure of iron wire, which is twisted together in only a few places and is hastily taped in others, gives the impression of a rapid and intuitive work process. Some “Balubas” possess a fragile equilibrium and look as though Tinguely had quickly sketched them in space."
Ballet of the Poor,Tinguely Jean,Nouveau Réalisme,installation,"In March 1961, the important travelling exhibition “Bewogen Beweging” opened in Amsterdam, giving the public its first comprehensive overview of kinetic art from the Futurists to Alexander Calder. Among the 72 artists, Jean Tinguely was represented with no less than 28 works. For the show’s second venue, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Tinguely built two new machine sculptures. One of these is “Miramar”, which the artist later renamed “Ballet des pauvres” (Ballet of the Poor) due to the reactions of museumgoers.

Pathetic-looking, ragged, defective and discarded objects from our everyday lives hang on wires and rubber bands from the ceiling, immobile. Underneath them is a nightgown, a prosthetic leg sporting a red stocking, a pot without a bottom, a shabby fox fur and a silver-coloured serving tray. All of these cast-offs are affixed via a suspended ceiling to camshafts and nine lever arms connected to a motor that is switched on by a timer. Suddenly and without warning, this sad array of consumer refuse bursts into explosive and spastic motion before the eyes of the non-suspecting observer, shaking and gyrating chaotically. The individual shapes and materials are dissolved in the high-speed whirl to form an indefinable whole. Accompanying the spectacle is a loud clattering generated by the collisions of the metal objects.

Tinguely deliberately deployed the feeling of uncertainty provoked in the viewer and the surprise effect as artistic means of expression. More than hardly any other work of that era, “Ballet des pauvres“ attests to the continual expansion of Jean Tinguely’s artistic vocabulary at the beginning of the 1960s. The movements and materials with which he works become increasingly expressive, wilder and more chaotic, departing significantly from the mainly geometric and constructive reliefs he executed in the 1950s. Tinguely would continue to pursue the idea of unbridled, “free-flowing“ machine sculptures in 1961 with his “Balubas”."
Radio-Skulptur,Tinguely Jean,"Kinetic Art, Nouveau Réalisme",sculpture,"Sound takes on a whole new dimension in Tinguely’s radio sculptures. It is no longer merely the motor or machine making noise; nor do the sounds come from the machine-driven striking of pots or drums. These are fully new, always up-to-the-minute original sounds produced by the radio. The world of communication and rapid news underpins the declamatory sculptures with their loudspeaker faces. Daily life is brought into the realm of art, not as a depiction, but rather dismembered into sentence or music fragments."
Suzuki (Hiroshima),Tinguely Jean,"Kinetic Art, Nouveau Réalisme",sculpture,"In February 1963, Jean Tinguely arrived in Tokyo to prepare an exhibition at the Minami Gallery. As was his custom, the artist executed his sculptures on site in Japan, especially for the exhibition, using materials he found there. The parts he uses thus make reference to the host country. Tinguely searched Tokyo’s junkyards for pieces he could use in his sculptures and then put them together at the gallery. “J‘ai fait des Ikebanas stabilisés“, he wrote enthusiastically to his friend Pontus Hulten. He called his new sculptures “Casoar”, “Zing-Zing”, “Honda” and “Suzuki”. After the “Balubas“ and the other wild sculptures of previous years, these machines move in a calmer, more moderate rhythm. Nevertheless, a powerful, violent eruption still seems possible at any moment.

In transforming the Japanese influences he felt into the works he created in Tokyo, Tinguely manifests his role as “Homo Ludens“, playing with and mediating between the different cultures and connecting them with the help of machines and technology. A catalogue was published for the Tokyo show that came with a record album featuring the piece “Tinguely-Sound”, a composition by Japanese avant-garde musician Toshi Ichiyanagi."
Shooting Picture,Sainte Phalle Niki de,Nouveau Réalisme,abstract,"The emphasis on the violent gesture in post-war abstract painting culminated in Saint Phalle's Shooting Pictures. She filled polythene bags with paint and enclosed them within layers of plaster against a blockboard backing. Spectators were invited to shoot at these constructions, releasing the paint. This one was shot by artists Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. The moment of action and an emphasis on chance were as important as the finished work. Saint Phalle stopped making these works in 1963, explaining 'I had become addicted to shooting, like one becomes addicted to a drug'."
Infinity Mirror Room,Kusama Yayoi,"Conceptual Art, Feminist Art",installation,"Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Room, a large scale mirrored installation was part of her solo exhibition “Floor Show” which opened at the Castellane Gallery, New York in November 1965.

The floor of the mirror-lined room was lined in white phallic blobs covered in red polka dots. Kusama posed placid on the floor in a red body suit. The seemingly endless, dotted environment was a reflection of the artist’s psychological state, her experience of acute depression and personal observations of the repetitiveness of daily life. Kusama coined the term Obsessional Art to describe her work."
Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn,Weiwei Ai,Conceptual Art,performance,"Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn is a photographic artwork created by Ai Weiwei in 1995. Composed of three 148 by 121 cm black-and-white photographs, it documents Ai holding, dropping, and standing over the remains of a Han dynasty urn that was approximately 2,000 years old."

Drawing Restraint 2,Barney Matthew,Performance Art,"performance, video","The [i]Drawing Restraint[/i] series was a long-term project that Barney began in 1987 while still an undergraduate at Yale. The earliest in the series ([i]Drawing Restraint 1-6[/i], produced between 1987-89) brought together drawing, photography, and video performance in a way that reflected Barney's preoccupation with hypertrophy; that being the idea that athletic physicality and strength is built up through muscle resistance.

[i]Drawing Restraint 2[/i] was a gymnasium-based performance in which the artist made artistic ""marks"" on walls and ceiling while tethered to a ramp with bungee cords. Through this experiment, Barney had effectively confronted the time-honored maxim that the best art is a spontaneous, reflexive, activity. By applying the idea of hypertrophy to artistic growth - be that physical, cultural, or spiritual - he explored the concept that the ""strongest"" artists (like the strongest athletes) should have to overcome self-imposed obstacles in order to create something ""higher""; something more ""powerful"". The resultant video recording, drawings, and ""set"" (featuring various items of gym apparatus) exist as an archive of the performance. Fellow artist Sophie Arkette observed that ""These works do not refer to something static, a composed form, but reveal the way one action precipitates another in the course of making a work [...] What is crucial in the life of work is the attempt at doing something regardless of the outcome. In this sense, [Barney's] ethos is akin to that of experimental work of the 60s and 70s"".

Drawing Restraint 7,Barney Matthew,Performance Art,"performance, video","Having begun (with [i]Drawing Restraint 1-6[/i]) to experiment with video installation, [i]Drawing Restraint 7[/i] marked a transitional moment in a series Barney and through video installation he was able to make ""stories rather than documenting real actions"". Despite its formal differences, however, [i]Drawing Restraint 7[/i] continued to explore the concept of creative growth by overcoming external and self-imposed restrictions. [i]Drawing Restraint 7[/i] also deals with one of Barney's other preoccupations, namely Western culture's obsession with the idea of masculinity as a performance that sates from ancient Greece to the present. In the video, actors wearing heavy make-up, cumbersome prosthetics, and costumes, play the roles of satyrs engaged in seemingly futile physical activities, such as chasing their own tails or attempting to draw while wrestling in the confined space of the backseat of a limousine.

As Barney moved forward with the series (reaching [i]Drawing Restraint 19[/i] in 2013), he continued to place the body in a central role. Describing the series as a whole as ""an endless loop between desire and discipline"", the work explores the ritualistic processes of creation through a range of materials, settings, and characters. Art critic Quinn Latimer said of the [i]Drawing Restraint[/i] series that by ""delineating evermore elaborate contests of physical strength and psychological willpower against resistance at turns physical, sexual, architectural, cultural, oceanic or spiritual, the series resembles the endless tragicomic trials of a Greek demigod, or its most contemporary incarnation, the athlete [...] the body and its tribulations are central to his practice [and] his thoroughly Postmodern work furthers one of the oldest art-historical traditions: figuration"".

The Cremaster Cycle,Barney Matthew,Contemporary,video,"Barney's magnum opus, [i]The Cremaster Cycle[/i], is comprised of five high-budget, films. Here he employs the narrative modes of mythology, history, and (auto) biography to explore complex biological, artistic, geological, and geographical themes. The films make use of dense, surrealistic, and highly-sexualized imagery, married with vividly-colored and elaborate props, make-up, prosthetics, and costumes. They are filmed in locations ranging from a palace in Budapest, the Isle of Man, and the salt flats of Utah - meanwhile, actors in the series include the actress Ursula Andress, the sculptor [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/richard-serra]Richard Serra[/url], the athlete Aimee Mullins and the writer Norman Mailer. The film's also star chorus girls, tap dancers, Canadian Mounties, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, helicopter pilots, bee trainers, and heavy metal bands.

Viewed in order, the films follow the embryonic process of sexual differentiation, beginning in [i]Cremaster 1[/i] with the ""ascended"" or undifferentiated state, and ending in [i]Cremaster 5[/i] at the most ""descended"" or differentiated state, about nine weeks after conception, when the male sex is fully realized. For Barney, the films simultaneously allude to the process of creative development. He explains that [i]Cremaster 1[/i] represents the spark of an idea; [i]Cremaster 2[/i] is the rejection of the idea; [i]Cremaster 3[/i] is the artist falling in love with the idea; [i]Cremaster 4[/i] is panic at the knowledge that the idea is about to come to fruition, and [i]Cremaster 5[/i] is the final resolution.

Barney, however, produced and released the five films non-chronologically, beginning with [i]Cremaster 4[/i] (1994), followed by [i]Cremaster 1[/i] (1995), [i]Cremaster 5[/i] (1997), [i]Cremaster 2[/i] (1999), and ending with [i]Cremaster 3[/i] (2002). This discontinuity would seem to underscore Barney's view that these processes (the biological process of becoming, and the artistic process of creating) are complex and non-linear. Even though each film follows a different set of mythological and historical characters, they continually cross-reference (they are ""inter-textual"" in other words). The production designer Matthew D. Ryle asserts that ""anyone can access [the films] from any point; from fashion, horror movies, architecture, drawing, photography, football, plastics - or just story-telling"". But not everyone was won-over by Barney's extravagant vision, with arts journalist Matt Turner describing the series as ""an exhausting experience, demonstrating a weirdness that is wearying, a dedication to a provocation that comes to feel laborious, and much material that feels like baggage""."
Blood of Two,Barney Matthew,Superflat,performance,"This site-specific performance was created by Barney in collaboration with American visual artist Elizabeth Peyton for the inauguration of the new [i]DESTE Foundation Project Space[/i], housed in the former slaughterhouse on Hydra Island in Greece. The piece drew inspiration from the local natural environment and the population (their culture, tradition, religion, and ritual). Three months prior to the performance, a heavy bronze and glass vitrine was submerged in the sea by a group of divers, in a small cove near the [i]Project Space[/i]. The vitrine contained five collaborative drawings produced by Barney and Peyton in pencil and blood, showing animals, agricultural scenes, and mythological figures, as well as a bronze book.

At dawn on the day of the performance, local fishermen retrieved the heavy vitrine from the water and carried it up a narrow staircase to the road. Next, the carcass of a dogfish shark (referencing fishing traditions and religious imagery) was laid atop the vitrine. The vitrine and shark were then placed in a wooden cart, pulled by a horse to the site of the former slaughterhouse, accompanied by a procession of human participants. Once inside the slaughterhouse, the head fisherman opened the vitrine, allowing the seawater to pour out dramatically onto the floor, and revealing the artistic contents hidden inside. The bronze book had developed an aquamarine patina, during its three months underwater. The shark was later cooked and fed to visitors. The video of this performance was just one of several artworks (including sculptures by Barney and paintings by Peyton) that comprised the inaugural exhibition of the [i]Project Space[/i], which was supported by the Municipality of Hydra and Hydra's Ecologist Society.

The art critic Chris Bors described [i]Blood of Two[/i] as ""a ritualistic artwork that encompasses local customs without succumbing to the tropes of cultural tourism"". Indeed, he points out that the event borrowed from a local Easter tradition that ""inaugurated the traditional Miaoulia festival, honoring those who fought in the Greek Revolution [during] the war for independence from Turkey, which began in 1821"". Bors also pointed out that while they ""remained true to their own visual languages"", Barney and Peyton had managed to put to one side their excessive and romantic (respectively) tendencies to ""engage the people of Hydra and the island's history, making them participants rather than viewers [in an] anthropological, experiential project in tune with [Hydra's] distinctive setting"".

River of Fundament,Barney Matthew,Contemporary,video,"This near six-hour film, which takes the form of a three-act opera, was inspired by Norman Mailer's 700-page historical novel [i]Ancient Evenings[/i] (1983). Mailer's novel, which met with critical derision on its release, deals with ancient Egyptian history and mythology, death and reincarnation, and sexuality. Featuring a cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Elaine Stritch, Salman Rushdie, Debbie Harry, YouTube ""beatboxer"" Ryan Robinson and Paul Giamatti, [i]River of Fundament[/i] draws upon and reconstructs Ancient Evenings, simultaneously incorporating the modern history of the rise and fall of the American car industry. Automotive processes are presented with what art critic Adrian Searle calls ""the character of rites and rituals,"" such as scenes in which a car is dismembered in a Los Angeles showroom, and subsequently smelted in Detroit.

The film also includes a number of explicit sexual scenes that Searle describes as ""hard to take"". In one scene, a man, whose penis is covered in human excrement and gold leaf, engages in anal sex. In another, a woman copulates with a car engine, and in yet another, two women engage in sexual play with a dildo that appears to be made of feces. For both Mailer and Barney, feces represent both death and fertility. Barney cites Maggie Nelson's 2011 book [i]Art of Cruelty[/i] as a significant influence upon his view of such ""extreme images"", explaining that ""I think my interest in [explicit scenes] has nothing at all to do with political provocation. I think it has to do with taking a kind of fundamental, albeit extreme, action and trying to naturalize it into the context of the narrative, or into what's happening on screen. And so in some way, it's about trying to remove its shock value"".

Art critic Sebastian Smee described the film as ""disgusting, dazzling and weirdly great"" but that, ultimately, the film was ""close to unbearable"". He argued that people were often uneasy about celebrating Barney's work because it came with ""a realization that giving oneself over to his aesthetic was like joining a cult"" [...] If you believe, it's like baptism: You are absorbed into an intellectually stimulating subculture where everything makes more and more sense the deeper you delve. If you don't - if you think the work solipsistic, its relationship to reality fragile - you save yourself a lot of trouble. But you also miss out on the fun""."
Redoubt,Barney Matthew,Contemporary,video,"[i]Redoubt[/i] (""American Redoubt"" is a conservative-libertarian movement, established in 2011, that seeks to establish Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as safe havens for conservative Christians and Jews in the event of catastrophe) offers a contemporary take on mythology which Barney combines here with another of his preoccupations: humanity's relationship with the natural world; in this case the wilderness of the Sawtooth mountains of Idaho (the area where Barney grew up). With an experimental score by Johnathan Bepler, the two-hour-plus, dialogue-free film blends the ancient myth of Diana and Actaeon with contemporary American issues, including gun ownership, the paranoia of the government, and the reintroduction of wolves into the Sawtooth range after their close call with extinction (around the time of Barney's childhood).

Debruge argues that the use of drone cameras in the film ""is suitably otherworldly, suggesting a point of view that alternates between the hunter and the hunted from the film's opening shots, alternating between a bloody animal carcass as seen from above and a skyward-pointing view of the bird of prey circling overhead"". Debruge notes too, that, with only six human characters, the film's focus remains on the natural landscape, thus presenting the ""human characters as trespassers into this snowy 'virgin' territory""; an idea reflected in the fact that the protagonist, Diana, and her two attendants, are also virgins.

Smee picked up on a talk given by Barney at Yale to mark the event of an exclusive screening of his film. Barney had spoken to his ""converted"" audience about ""a kind of yearning one has to have a functionality to what one's doing - for the works to have some function"". Smee, while sympathizing with Barney's view, argued that art is not (or should not be) a ""teaching tool"" and when it does ""function"" in this way the art and its audience become ""too self-enclosed"". Smee surmised, however, that Barney was mindful of his own predicament but that his ""endlessly curious intelligence reaches out to the world in all its complexity"". In fact, Smee suggested that the more ""ingeniously elaborated and dazzlingly executed his work"" the less considered it becomes and ""the more bizarre, eccentric and nakedly pointless it appears""."
Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995,Emin Tracey,Conceptual Art,installation,"Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (1995), also known as ""The Tent"", was an artwork created by Tracey Emin RA (born 3 July 1963), an English artist and a leading member of the group known as Britartists or YBAs (Young British Artists). The work was a tent with the appliquéd names of, literally, everyone she had ever slept with, but not necessarily in the sexual sense. It achieved iconic status, was owned by Charles Saatchi, and was destroyed in the 2004 Momart London warehouse fire. She has refused to recreate it."
My Bed,Emin Tracey,Conceptual Art,installation,"My Bed is a work by the British artist Tracey Emin. First created in 1998, it was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in 1999 as one of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has persisted.

The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the fact that the bedsheets were stained with bodily secretions and the floor had items from the artist's room (such as condoms, a pair of knickers with menstrual period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects, including a pair of slippers). The bed was presented in the state that Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship difficulties.

Two performance artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, jumped on the bed with bare torsos in order to improve the work, which they thought had not gone far enough. They called their performance Two Naked Men Jump Into Tracey's Bed. The men also had a pillow fight on the bed for around fifteen minutes, to applause from the crowd, before being removed by security guards. The artists were detained but no further action was taken. Prior to its Tate Gallery showing, the work had appeared elsewhere, including Japan, where there were variant surroundings, including at one stage a hangman's noose hanging over the bed. This was not present when it was displayed at the Tate.

My Bed was bought by Charles Saatchi for £150,000 and displayed as part of the first exhibition when the Saatchi Gallery opened its new premises at County Hall, London (which it has now vacated). Saatchi also installed the bed in a dedicated room in his own home."
44th Wire Piece,Tuttle Richard,Minimalism,sculpture,"44th Wire Piece is part of a series of 48 wire works that reflects Richard Tuttle’s thinking about the relationships between drawing and sculpture. To install the work, Tuttle enters a meditative state in order to recall the length and width of the line necessary to create a given piece. After drawing that line in one fluid motion directly on the wall, he then unspools a filament of florist wire, anchoring one end to the drawn line’s point of origin with a small nail. Tuttle traces the line’s trajectory with the wire filament, fastening its other end to the wall at the end of the line. The final work is a line that exists in three dimensions, with the shadow cast by the wire making a third linear element."

Bob’s Worlds,Schnabel Julian,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"[i]Bob’s Worlds[/i] (1980) is one of Julian Schnabel’s early 'broken plate paintings'. The origin of the 'plate technique' was Schnabel’s 1978 trip to Barcelona, Spain. There, he encountered the architecture of Antonio Gaudí and the intricate mosaic elements in [i]Casa Milà[/i] and [i]Park Güell[/i]. While in Barcelona, Schnabel imagined creating a giant painting covered with broken plates, which would match the size of the closet in his hotel room. After his return to New York, he implemented his vision, covering large wooden surfaces with broken dishes and thick layers of paint. The success of Schnabel and other [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-expressionism]Neo-Expressionist[/url] artists represented a shift in American art, which was dominated by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/minimalism]Minimalism[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/conceptual-art]Conceptual art[/url] in previous decades.

In this painting, Schnabel descends into art history by combining an array of references in an original and personal way. The artist divided [i]Bob’s Worlds[/i] into three sections, like the closet in his Barcelona hotel room. The left panel is narrow and covered with fragments of broken dishes, the central panel is purple with two large intertwining flowers, and the right panel also covered with broken plates features a sturdy sower walking with a hefty stack over his shoulder. In between the left and central panel, there is a nude male figure resembling a remnant of Greco-Roman sculpture. The image of the sower is mainly associated with the paintings of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh]Vincent Van Gogh[/url] [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh/sower-1888][i]Sower[/i][/url] (1888) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh/sower-with-setting-sun-1888-3][i]Sower with Setting Sun[/i][/url] (1888). The thick impasto effect further establishes a connection between Schnabel and Van Gogh. Still, at the same time, Schnabel sets himself apart by creating a unique sculptural surface with fragments of broken dishes. Expressionist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon]Francis Bacon[/url] also reinterpreted the motif of the sower in paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/study-for-a-portrait-of-van-gogh-1957][i]Study for Portrait of Van Gogh I[/i][/url] (1956). Even though in [i]Bob’s Worlds[/i], Schnabel drew inspiration from a variety of references to art history, his innovative combination created new associations for the viewer. For instance, the unique technique of broken plates can be associated with archeological remains of an ancient civilization. It also relates to the drip and splatter techniques of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionist[/url] painting. 
  
The title [i]Bob’s Worlds[/i] most likely refers to Bob Williamson, a fixture of the New York downtown culture scene during the late 1970s. He and Schnabel became close friends, and Williamson was a mentor figure for the artist. Another possibility is that Schnabel thought of Bob Mason, a young artist who was also his former assistant."
Portrait of Andy Warhol,Schnabel Julian,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"In [i]Portrait of Andy Warhol[/i] (1982), Julian Schnabel presented an eerie image of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop[/url] artist and cultural icon [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url]. In the 1980s, Warhol developed friendships with a younger generation of artists, which were considered part of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-expressionism]Neo-expressionist[/url] movement. Among them were [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-michel-basquiat]Jean-Michel Basquiat[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-salle]David Salle[/url], and Julian Schnabel. The friendship between Warhol and Schnabel resulted in an artistic exchange. The same year Schnabel painted [i]Portrait of Andy Warhol[/i] (1982), Warhol reciprocated by creating [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol/julian-schnabel-1982][i]Julian Schnabel[/i][/url] (1982). Most of Schnabel’s portraits were done from real life and executed without preliminary drawings. This portrait was no exception, as Warhol sat for Schnabel a few times until he completed the painting. Schnabel portrayed a thin and fragile Warhol, who appears to be in a weak state, almost like a ghost; he seems to dematerialize in front of the viewer. Warhol is depicted shirtless wearing a supporting garment around his waist, marked with pink brushstrokes. The supporting device was due to 1968 attempted the murder of Warhol by radical feminist Valerie Solanas. This left a profound impact on Warhol, who was deeply traumatized by the incident.

Schnabel continued his use of unconventional materials by choosing to paint on black velvet. The shiny quality of the velvet allows the color palette of light tones, yellows, grays, and pinks to stand out. In Schnabel’s art, the use of unconventional materials is an essential element: whether its broken plates, velvet, or fur, they all produce pictorial and psychological effects. When the viewers notice the everyday object incorporated in the paintings, they have the memory and association of the object’s everyday use and function.  

Scholars have pointed out how Schnabel subtly references different artists in the portrait’s color palette, style, and atmosphere. For instance, Warhol’s vulnerable presence and wiry figure evoke a similar mood as the figures of the saints painted by Spanish Renaissance artist [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco]El Greco[/url]. Schnabel possibly wanted to provoke religious connotations since many of his works feature Catholic iconography and themes. The painting has a sense of mystery that can be interpreted as a mystic or spiritual quality. In the same way, the colors and dark mood can be associated with the portraits of Expressionist painter [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon]Francis Bacon[/url], like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/after-the-life-mask-of-william-blake-1955][i]Study for a Portrait I (After the life mask of William Blake)[/url][/i] (1955) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francis-bacon/man-in-blue-vii-1954][i]Man in Blue VII[/i][/url] (1954).

The artist chose to place Warhol on the left side of the canvas, allowing different elements to play out on the other side of the painting. Schnabel fills the right side of the canvas with white dots and small strokes of blue and yellow. At the center of the painting, there is a mark of brown paint - this type of biomorphic shape will become frequent in Schnabel’s later paintings. The dark background may represent a movie theater, and the specks of color are glittering dust coming from the light of the film projector."
Resurrection. Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry,Schnabel Julian,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"[i]Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry[/i] (1984) was inspired by the 1984 John Huston film rendition of Malcolm Lowry’s novel [i]Under the Volcano[/i]. The movie starred Albert Finney as Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic British consul in the Mexican town of Quanhnahuac on [i]Día de Muertos[/i] (the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead). Schnabel often connected his painting to the world of cinema, referencing films, actors, and directors in his titles: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/norma-pool-painting-for-norma-desmond-1975][i]Pool Painting (for Norma Desmond)[/i][/url] (1975), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/untitled-brando-2008][i]Untitled (Brando)[/i][/url] (2008), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/last-diary-entry-for-roman-polanski-2010][i]Last Diary Entry (For Roman Polanski)[/i][/url] (2010). 

Schnabel’s painting depicts [i]El Ninõ de Atocha[/i], the Roman Catholic image of Child Christ, which is famous throughout Spanish speaking countries like Mexico. The artist painted the traditional attributes of [i]El Ninõ de Atocha[/i] - the halo, the pilgrim’s cloak, and the staff. In the backdrop, Schnabel painted a crude landscape that creates the effect of a levitating figure. The artist’s interest in Catholic iconography, especially the one connected to Mexican culture, is prominent in many of his paintings. At the age of 13, Schnabel and his family moved to the border town of Brownsville, Texas. There he became familiar with Mexican culture; later, as an adult, he often traveled to Mexico. Schnabel’s familiarity with Mexican culture and folk art is evident in [i]Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry[/i]. He echoes religious imagery of Mexican folk art: [i]retablo[/i], a small devotional painting that serves as a votive offering, and [i]milagros[/i], a religious folk charm used for votive offering or healing purposes.

Schnabel may have been drawn to religious imagery because he seeked to channel spirituality and mysticism. In [i]Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry[/i] he channeled elements of Mexican devotional folk art into creating a contemporary spiritual image. His paintings are imaginary encounters between personalities that could not meet in real life like Malcolm Lowry and Albert Finney, and Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/painting-for-malik-joyeux-and-bernardo-bertolucci-v-2006][i]Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V)[/i][/url] (2006). Although many of Schnabel’s paintings feature Catholic iconography, the artist explored a variety of religious concepts in his art, for example, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/fakires-fakirrak-1993][i]Fakires[/i][/url] (1993) referenced Sufi mysticism and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/untitled-shiva-2007][i]Untitled (Shiva)[/i][/url] (2007) is one of several paintings dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.

In [i]Resurrection: Albert Finney Meets Malcolm Lowry[/i], Schnabel depicts a traditional religious subject combining several modernist styles of painting. The face is reminiscent of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url]’s portraits, the splatter technique is suggestive of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Jackson Pollock[/url], and spray-painted lines allude to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/dan-christensen]Dan Christensen[/url]’s abstract paintings. Schnabel also continued to experiment with unconventional materials by executing the painting on purple velvet. The artist demonstrated his creativity and innovation by integrating traditional subject matter, modernist style, and use of unconventional materials. In the painting, he pays tribute to the artistic encounter between Lowry’s literary creation and Albert Finney’s performance in the medium of cinema. In a sense, Schnabel continues the dialogue between different mediums by giving a visual interpretation of [i]Under the Volcano[/i]."
Spain ( Espainia ),Schnabel Julian,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"Julian Schnabel is best known for his 'plate paintings', like [i]Spain[/i] (1986). Spain and other plate paintings from the period, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/the-red-sky-1984][i]The Red Sky[/i][/url] (1984) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/australia-1986][i]Australia[/i][/url] (1986), were created from broken dishes, thick layers of oil paint and Bondo - a type of putty used for automotive and household repairs. These stood in contrast to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/minimalism]Minimal[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/conceptual-art]Conceptual[/url] art, the prevailing trends of the 1960s and 1970s. Scholars have categorized Schnabel as a [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/neo-expressionism]Neo-expressionist[/url] (a term that the artist does not wholly identify with), and one of the significant figures in the 1980s revival of the traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. At the same time, Schnabel did not conform to painting conventions: he was experimental in his approach and use of unconventional materials and techniques. It is evident in his 1980s plate paintings, and it remains a significant component of his work throughout his career. This approach can also be linked to earlier trends in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-minimalism]Post-Minimalist[/url] sculpture and the works of early 1970s abstract artists, such as Alan Shields and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/harmony-hammond]Harmony Hammond[/url].

In 'plate paintings', such as [i]Spain[/i], Schnabel built on the legacy of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/abstract-expressionism]Abstract Expressionism[/url], the art movement that developed after World War II. The overall effect of the thick impasto and the sculptural surfaces in [i]Spain[/i] is similar to the expressive brushstrokes and splatters of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Jackson Pollock[/url]’s paintings [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock/mural-on-indian-red-ground-1950][i]Mural on Indian red ground[/i][/url] (1950) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock/number-25][i]Number 25[/i][/url] (1950). Schnabel also combined other sources of inspiration for his 1980s 'plate paintings' like cubist forms of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url] and cultural artifacts found in Mexico. Another essential characteristic of the 'plate paintings' is their monumental size; [i]Spain[/i], for instance, stands at 333x513 cm, overwhelming the viewer.

[i]Spain[/i] is representative of Schnabel’s fascination with the country and its culture. It was inspired by the artist’s 1987 visit to Barcelona, especially by the architecture of Antonio Gaudí, whose structures are an integral part of the city’s identity. The texture created by the broken plates is reminiscent of the mosaic elements in Gaudí’s [i]Casa Milà[/i] and [i]Park Güell[/i]. In 'plate paintings' like [i]Spain[/i], Schnabel transformed the surface of the artwork: the jagged edges of broken plates and cups bulge out to create a unique kind of texture, similar to a low relief. The central motif in the painting appears to be a severed head, which is a recurrent theme in Schnabel’s work. The head seems to be situated in a bullfighting ring, located behind a [i]burladero[/i] - a barrier used by bullfighters for protection from the bull. The snout-like face can belong either to a bull or a bullfighter, making the scene somewhat ambiguous and unclear. Schnabel selected a warm palette of earthy tones of reds and ochres, mixed with dark tones that mark long shadows. The color scheme could be a reference to a Spanish landscape, or it might symbolize the colors of the Spanish national flag."
Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V),Schnabel Julian,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"[i]Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V)[/i] (2006) belongs to a series of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/all-works#!#filterName:Series_surf-paintings-2006,resultType:masonry][i]Surf Paintings[/i][/url]. Schnabel used black and white photographs as the basis for his paintings to which he added gestural strokes painted in soluble gesso and ink. The giant photograph depicts a surfer catching a monster wave at the Banzai Pipeline off Oahu in Hawaii. In [i]Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V)[/i], water is both the subject and the material of the painting. The gestural white mark created with gesso is then partially washed off with a hose, which creates this type of unique dripping effect. The enormous canvas (609.6x457.2 cm) amplifies the wave and makes the viewers feel like they are inside it. It is also the purpose of the white mark; with his gestural strokes, Schnabel echoes the photographic image of the wave.

The title suggests Schnabel’s admiration for two figures: the Tahitian Big Wave surfer Malik Joyeux, who tragically died in a surfing accident in 2005 at the Oahu Pipeline in Hawaii, and the Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci. More broadly, the series combined Schanbel’s two passions, film, and surfing. For Schnabel, the ocean and the sea are essential, and water, in general, is a noticeable element in his art: in paintings such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/the-sea-1981][i]The Sea[/i][/url] (1981) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/affection-for-surfing-1983][i]Affection for Surfing[/i][/url] (1983), and his films. From his youth, Schnabel became immersed in surf culture, and later, he chose to live and paint in Montauk, New York - a place where he can surf and always be close to the water.

Schnabel watched Bertolucci’s movies in the 1970s while living in Europe. His painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/julian-schnabel/giacomo-expelled-from-the-temple-1978][i]Giacomo Expelled from the Temple[/i][/url] (1976-1978), located in the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), was first called [i]Restaurant Painting for Bernardo[/i]. Schnabel initially connected the painting to Bertolluci since the warm light of his films inspired the artist. Years later, Schnabel met Bertolucci, and the two became close friends. According to Schnabel, the concept of the series came about from his conversations with Bertolucci, who at the time was worried about his health and his ability to continue making films. Schnabel found that there is a parallel between surfing and creating art, the physical struggle and pain involved with surfing ultimately are done for the extraordinary sensation of being in the wave. This feeling is a kind of transcendence in which one is relieved of everything ordinary and familiar. Schnabel wanted to send this message of encouragement to Bertolucci, whose motivation for making movies was to put forward something from within that goes beyond physical limitations. [i]Painting for Malik Joyeux and Bernardo Bertolucci (V)[/i] (2006) brings together two unlikely figures. In dedicating the series to Joyeux and Bertolucci, Schnabel made a connection between two individuals that never had an opportunity to meet. It illustrated the power of art to make a connection between people that could not happen in reality."
Untitled,Smith Kiki,Feminist Art,installation,"In this work, twelve water-cooler bottles, silvered to a mirror surface, are each engraved with the name of a different bodily fluid: blood, tears, urine, milk, and more. The piece was inspired, Smith has said, by the medieval book of hours, the volumes of Christian observance that provided ""some kind of meditation, something you could think about or believe in,"" for every hour of the day. Choosing ""fluids everyone knows about that come out of the body,"" Smith found physical substitutes for the intangibles of religious belief. She also created a provocative friction between the scale and uniform shape of the bottles and the intimate and internal processes evoked by the words they bear.

For Smith, the human body, even more than human consciousness, is ""our primary vehicle for experiencing our lives."" A more consistent presence in Smith's art than any format or medium (her materials range from concrete to glass, and she has also produced many prints), the body is a widespread concern in the art of the 1980s and 1990s. This focus is partly aesthetic, reflecting a need to break from immediate precedents—the dematerialized linguistic propositions of Conceptual art, or the hard, machine-made, geometric surfaces of Minimalism. But the period also saw intense public debate on issues of sexuality and health, and on their convergence in the AIDS crisis."
Untitled,Smith Kiki,Feminist Art,figurative,"In this radical lithograph, her first, Smith used imprints and photocopies of her own hair, face, and neck, along with a ""Cher"" wig, to create a wild, dynamic linear web. This print was one of the first in which she used her own body as part of the printmaking process (Body Art). It signaled the uniquely inventive and sculptural approach that would characterize much of Smith's work at ULAE."
Virgin Mary,Smith Kiki,Feminist Art,sculpture,"Smith's sculpture, Virgin Mary, explores the elemental functions of the female body from a Feminist perspective while incorporating the iconography of her Catholic faith. The sculpture appropriates the image of the revered matriarch of Catholicism, but removes the luster of centuries of veneration to reveal those vital differences that elevate her above all women.

The wax figure is nearly life-size, depicting a nude body without skin, revealing the musculoskeletal system, while the head, hands, breasts, genitalia, and feet retain their pale flesh. The sculpture's open-arm posture is reminiscent of Eurocentric 'Virgin Mary' images and early Christianity's Orans figures. However, Smith withholds Mary's traditional attributes, including the halo, blue robe, bejeweled crown, lilies, roses, and nursing infant, which generated an otherworldly aura meant to elevate her above all women.

Smith's sculpture invites viewers to acknowledge the woman beneath the veneer of holy mysticism, revealing Mary as simply flesh and blood. By retaining the portions of her body for which she was adored, such as her breasts, uterus, and hands, Smith's sculpture exposes the affinity Mary shares with all women, including the blood and bodily functions, muscle, sinew, and bone. The viewer is left with a conundrum, forced to decide whether the venerated figure was simply human or if a woman's body is truly sacred."
Big Night down the Drain,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"Big Night Down the Drain depicts a young boy, perhaps a self-portrait of the artist, holding an exaggerated phallus, and is one of Baselitz's most controversial paintings. It was inspired by an article about the Irish playwright Brendan Behan, who was a notorious drunk, and we might compare it to the many other images Baselitz later produced which depict the figure of the artist. During his first solo exhibition in 1963, at a Berlin gallery, the painting was seized by the public prosecutor's office for ""infringement of public morality."" The shocking subject was intended to encourage an awakening that Baselitz thought was necessary in a post-war Germany lulled into amnesia about its recent past. ""I proceed from a state of disharmony, from ugly things,"" he once said, and this confrontation with ugliness was something he believed was necessary to confront the violence of twentieth century history."
Rebel,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,portrait,"In the mid-1960s, Baselitz embarked on a series of paintings depicting male figures that dominate the space of the picture. While they bear some relation to the heroic figures of Social Realist art, they were also portrayed as wounded or dishevelled. According to the artist, this figure holds the pole of a flag in one hand, while the other hand is bandaged. Details such as the burning house appear in other works in the series. 'I was concerned with a very direct, almost illustrative method of representation', Baselitz has said of this work."
The Wood On Its Head,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"The Wood on its Head is Baselitz's first inverted painting, in which he upends his subject matter to frustrate recognition of the objects depicted. Its motif, based on a picture by the early 19th century painter Louis Ferdinand von Rayski, is similar to those found in his previous work, but here he makes them secondary to the physical properties of the medium. This radical approach troubles our ability to interpret the picture, leaving us wondering whether we are now looking at an abstraction or, simply, a conventional landscape upturned. We might read it as symptomatic of Baselitz's continuing attempts to find a different path from those that had been dominant when he emerged - the gestural abstraction of Paris and New York, and the Socialist Realism of the Eastern bloc."
Female Nude on a Kitchen Chair,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,nude painting (nu),"Baselitz emphasises the very physical nature of making his large format prints, seeing the process of cutting into the surface of lino or wood as an act of the body rather than the mind. This female nude is a portrait of Baselitz’s wife, Elke. Baselitz began by rapidly drawing the outlines of the figure directly onto a sheet of linoleum, then cutting into it, adding dense networks of lines. After working on the print for two days in February 1977 he put it aside, then returned to it and completed it in May 1979."
Model for a Sculpture,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,sculpture,"Model for a Sculpture, Baselitz's first sculpture, typifies his crude treatment of wood in this medium - a treatment analogous to his treatment of paint in his previous work. Similar in its primitivizing tendency to the work of artists such as Ludwig Kirchner, Baselitz found inspiration for the approach in African sculpture, believing it to offer a model for a more spontaneous expression of movement and human emotion. The work was first exhibited in the West German Pavilion of the Venice Biennale in 1980. Baselitz had originally intended to show paintings, but changed his mind at a late stage and sent only this sculpture. The work immediately sparked controversy, since the raised arm gesture of the figure is similar to the that of a Nazi salute; the red and black coloring of the figure has also been interpreted as a reference to the colors of the Third Reich. However, other sources for the sculpture suggest themselves: perhaps the Futurist bronze, Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, by Umberto Boccioni; and Baselitz has also said that the work was inspired by an edible souvenir available at a market in Dresden. The gesture of the figure - a figure bound to the ground by a block of wood - might simply communicate frustration."
Adieu,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"Baselitz began to paint figures upside-down in the late 1960s, insisting that viewers should concentrate on the lines and marks of the painting rather than its resemblance to reality. He worked on this painting over a number of weeks, repeatedly adjusting the position of the two figures further apart from each other. The title Adieu reflects this sense of a growing separation: 'one of them is only half there, while the other is going away', the artist wrote. Asked about the chequerboard background, Baselitz recalled that, 'a starter's flag of a grand prix race was floating in my imagination'."
Head and Bottle,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"Head and Bottle best showcases Georg Baselitz's vigorous energy as a printmaker: the monumental print is 1000 x 485 mm in scale. Although the work depicts the bust of a man, through inversion the image is confused and hovers on the verge of abstraction. Each layer of color appears to be torn away from the surface, revealing the color underneath. It is similar in approach to some paintings that the artist produced around the same time, one depicting a man drinking from a glass, another showing a figure eating an orange. In a sense, the postures of the figures, and the objects they hold, simply accentuate the viewer's confusion when they appear upside-down, but some critics have also suggested that these everyday activities take on the character of a sacred ritual when they are depicted at such scale, and in such an unusual manner."
Dresdner Frauen-Karla,Baselitz Georg,Neo-Expressionism,sculpture,"Dresdner Frauen-Karla is one of a series of eleven monumental sculptural busts of women which commemorate the destruction of Dresden at the end of World War II. Baselitz grew up not far from the city, and remembered its destruction vividly. He wanted to pay homage to what he called the ""rubble women,"" who he believed embodied the reconstruction efforts of a broken city. The large block of wood that forms the piece has been hacked away by a chainsaw to create the crude facial features. She appears to be deteriorating, symbolizing the weakened state of Dresden. The intense gaze, enormous proportion, and pulsating yellow hue exhibit a strong emotional presence. Similar in tone to the figures in his Heroes series, Karla represents a woman scarred by war, yet defiant."
Chocolate Painting (Schokoladenbild),Polke Sigmar,Pop Art,figurative,"This work, painted while Polke was still a student, demonstrates the strong influence [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop art[/url] had over the artist in his formative years. Since Pop art had not become a phenomenon in Germany at that point, Polke's exposure to it was mostly via its dissemination in art magazines and newspapers. However, while American Pop was primarily concerned with brands and consumer goods, Polke instead chose to represent an unbranded chocolate bar that had already been opened, implying a different and perhaps a more subtle sensibility to that found in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol]Andy Warhol[/url]'s iconic and untouched [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol/campbells-soup-cans-1962]Campbell's soup[/url] cans, for example.

Having escaped from post-war communist East Germany to the West, Polke always viewed the commodities of capitalism in contrast to his own personal knowledge of the restrictions of communism. He once claimed, ""When I came to the West, I saw many, many things for the first time. But I also saw the prosperity of the West critically. It wasn't really Heaven."" This dual criticism of capitalism and communism came to the fore in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/capitalist-realism]Capitalist Realist[/url] group he co-launched the year before this work was executed.

The Capitalist Realists mocked the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/socialist-realism]Socialist Realist[/url] style of art endorsed by the Soviet Union, which dominated the art of many communist countries. Typically, Socialist Realism was openly nationalistic. Most often, art produced in this style - the only art sanctioned by the state - emphasized loyalty to the communist party and featured content that promoted party ideology. Polke exposes the bright idealism of Socialist Realism as well as Western consumerism in this work. [i]Chocolate Painting[/i] is a confluence of seemingly opposing ideologies: this chocolate bar, sans label, becomes a sort of signifier for banality, uniformity, and uncritical consumption. It mocks the sometimes sickeningly sweet imagery of Socialist Realism and blurs the line between the consumer and the ideology of consumption."
Bunnies,Polke Sigmar,New European Painting,figurative,"Polke's early painting, [i]Bunnies[/i], is an example of the artist's ability to distance the viewers while immersing them within the imagery simultaneously. The artwork may have been based on an advertisement for membership in Hugh Hefner's Playboy Clubs. The first of these clubs opened in 1960, and the original image would have functioned as more than just a photograph of beautiful women meant to evoke physical desire; it was also a compelling portrayal of a lifestyle that could be purchased. Polke dissolves these sex symbols into clusters of dots and streaks, exposing the image's seductive illusion. Polke frustrates the viewer's desire by emphasizing the materiality of the image at the expense of the clarity and individuality of the women.

[i]Bunnies[/i] is composed using a dot technique that characterizes several of his paintings completed in the mid-1960s. The technique is a clear reference to the famous dot paintings by [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/pop-art]Pop artists[/url] such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein]Roy Lichtenstein[/url]. However, Polke's dots are exaggerated and enlarged for impact. While Lichtenstein's works use dots to delineate and simplify a composition, Polke's dots function to distort and obscure his subjects. Polke's dot technique is known as Rasterbilder, referring to a method of dot printing using a raster screen. Eternally interested in processes of production and reproduction, Polke destabilizes the usually reliable printing process by introducing irregularly sized dots and additional colors.

In this work, Polke is playing with the audience's usual reactions to such images. Magazines such as [i]Playboy[/i] present women as physically appealing sexual objects, enticing the viewer to look closer at high-definition photographs in portable formats. By placing his large image (59 x 39.5 inches) on the wall of a gallery and drawing the viewer in to scrutinize the women's bodies in the public space of the museum, Polke makes the viewer feel uncomfortable and forces them to confront their habitual modes of viewing."
Potato House (Kartoffelhaus),Polke Sigmar,Conceptual Art,illustration,"Best known for his experiments in painting and photography, Polke also created several sculptures and installations throughout his career. One of these is [i]Potato House[/i], a lattice structure studded with real potatoes. This installation plays with the visual tropes of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/minimalism]Minimalism[/url], which frequently made use of cubes, grids, and reductive representations of shelters. However, Polke adds an organic element usually missing from Minimalist works, using his ornamental potatoes to poke fun at the movement's sobriety.

Potatoes make an appearance in multiple works by Polke, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/apparatus-whereby-one-potato-can-orbit-another-1969][i]Apparatus Whereby One Potato Can Orbit Another[/i][/url] (1969) or [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/potato-drawing-kartoffelzeichnung-1970][i]Potato Drawing[/i][/url] (1966-1970). In postwar Germany, potatoes were a staple in the diets of most people and were emblematic of the drab, devastated country in the war's aftermath. In this work, the potato structure can be seen either as sheltering or caging the viewer, who is invited to step inside. By entering the work, the viewer becomes an insider engaged in actively transforming the meaning of the piece, including challenging conventional prohibitions concerning the propriety of actually touching art.

[i]Potato House[/i] raises an interesting curatorial issue. Being organic and perishable, potatoes must be provided by each museum that chooses to exhibit the work. They must also be replaced before they begin to sprout, shrivel, or rot. Polke was notoriously disdainful of the institutional nature of museums, and this work functions as a challenge to both curators and museum-goers. In a sense, this work is not unlike the traditional [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/vanitas]vanitas[/url] images in which food and flowers, for instance, seem to be spoiling and wilting before our eyes, reminding us of how fleeting life is."
Ahatfenster,Polke Sigmar,New European Painting,design,"The Parish of Grossmünster, the most ancient church of Zurich, published in 2005 an art contest for the creation of the windows for the central nave. Between the five proposals, in the spring of 2006, the jury chose a design of Sigmar Polke. He crafted seven windows in the nave from agate, re-establishing the early Middle Ages tradition to produce the church windows out of cut stones (mainly, alabaster). Polke cut this semi-precious stone into thin slices that would let light pass through them and give the appearance of brightly glowing walls. The brilliantly colorful result was then expanded with five figurative glass windows. The motifs feature Old Testament figures: the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/der-sundenbock-2009]scapegoat[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/isaaks-opferung-2009]Isaac[/url], the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/menschensohn-2009]Son of Man[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/elijas-himmelfahrt-2009]Elijah[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sigmar-polke/konig-david-2009]David[/url]. They all move in the direction of the birth of Christ and thus toward the chancel window created by Augusto Giacometti in 1933.

Polke's formidable career was bookended with work in glass. He began his artistic training in 1959 as an apprentice in a glass-painting workshop, and he completed the Grossmünster windows a year before his death."
The Holy Virgin Mary,Ofili Chris,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"[i]The Holy Virgin Mary[/i] (1996) is likely the most famous and most controversial artwork by Chris Ofili. In a painting of monumental scale (253x182.2 cm), Ofili created his version of the Madonna: powerful, black, and sexual. Ofili explained that he found the traditional interpretations of the Virgin Mary painted by Old Masters to be sexually charged. In his version, he wanted to depict a hip hop Madonna. In [i]The Holy Virgin Mary[/i], he alluded to traditional iconography and imagery of the Virgin. Still, at the same time, he manipulated these conventions by injecting elements of irony and humor into the work.

The background, shimmering orange resin with glitter, is reminiscent of the gold leaf used in religious icons, and the small glittery dots give the effect of halo around the figure. The figure is surrounded by what from a distance appear to be butterflies, but are, in fact, cutouts of female genitalia from pornographic magazines. The pornographic cutouts reference images of black women in gangsta rap music and serve as a contrast to the sacred image and subject. The placement of the cutouts can also ironically reference images of [i]putti[/i] - nude chubby children with wings that were frequently depicted with the Holy Virgin in Renaissance paintings.

The Madonna adorns a blue robe, a traditional attribute of the Virgin Mary, with one of her breasts exposed. Ofili applied a round piece of dried, varnished elephant dung to mark her breast. He also used two balls of resin-covered elephant dung to prop up the painting, instead of taking the traditional approach of hanging it on the wall. The artist incorporated elephant dung in other paintings from the period, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/double-captain-shit-and-the-legend-of-the-black-stars-1997][i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i][/url] (1997) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/no-woman-no-cry-1998][i]No Woman No Cry[/i][/url] (1998). This practice was inspired by his first visit to Africa in 1992. He was struck by the energy of the African natural environment, and by applying the elephant dung onto the canvas, he found a way to incorporate the environment into his art. The elephant dung, widely used in Africa as a fertilizer, can be interpreted as a symbol of growth and motherhood.

The use of the elephant dung was what grabbed headlines and caused a big stir in 1999 when the painting traveled to the Brooklyn Museum as part of the exhibition [i]Sensation[/i]. The mayor of New York City at the time, Rudy Giuliani, tried to stop the painting from being shown by withholding funding from the Brooklyn Museum. The museum, however, did not budge: they sued the city and eventually won the court case. Furthermore, during the exhibition, the painting was vandalized by a man named Dennis Heiner, who managed to bypass security barriers and spray the canvas with white paint. Ultimately the controversy surrounding the painting raised Ofili’s international profile and solidified his position in the art world. While it is unknown to what extent the artist intended to provoke audiences with [i]The Holy Virgin Mary[/i], he certainly created a potent image that contrasted between profane and sacred. Additionally, it was important for Ofili to make a black Madonna. In the painting, he combined different facets of black culture: African heritage and American hip hop culture."
Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars,Ofili Chris,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"[i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i] (1997) features the character Captain Shit, a black superhero invented by the artist. The character made numerous appearances in Ofili’s paintings, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/the-naked-spirit-of-captain-shit-and-the-legend-of-the-black-stars-2001][i]The Naked Spirit of Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i][/url] (2001) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/the-adoration-of-captain-shit-and-the-legend-of-the-black-stars-2nd-version-1998][i]The Adoration of Captain Shit and the Legend of Black Stars [2nd version][/i][/url] (1998). Captain Shit was partly based on the Marvel comic hero Luke Cage, one of the earliest black superheroes, who first appeared in a comic in 1972. Luke Cage was created during the height of the Blaxploitation film genre, and for Ofili, Cage was a symbol of the stereotypical depictions of black masculinity in the 1970s popular culture. In creating Captain Shit, the artist made a direct connection to the aesthetics of Blaxploitation movies, soul, and funk music. His aesthetic can also be linked to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barkley-l-hendricks]Barkley L. Hendricks[/url]’s stylish portraits of black individuals from the 1970s: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barkley-l-hendricks/northern-lights-1976][i]Northern Lights[/i][/url] (1976) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/barkley-l-hendricks/sir-charles-alias-while-harris-1972][i]Sir Charles, Alias While Harris[/i][/url] (1972).

[i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i] depicts two overlapping figures of Captain Shit. The painting has a tactile quality; its surface is covered with layers of glitter, pins, and resin. The cream-colored background is filled with black stars with cutouts of eyes at the center, which were clipped from magazines. The stars can be interpreted as untold stories of fame in black history and culture. The figures are composed of small dots of black, red, and yellow and touches of green in the fingernails. Ofili chose to create belt buckles out of elephant dung with the initials ‘CS’ written in yellow and black, standing for Captain Shit. Lumps of elephant dung were also placed on top of the painting and on the floor to support it in a vertical position.

Both the technique of small dots and the use of elephant dung are practices inspired by a 1992 artist's research trip to Zimbabwe. For Ofili, elephant dung was an interesting material as it was a trace of wildlife, and its inclusion was a way of incorporating the natural African environment into his art. During his visit to Zimbabwe, he also saw ancient cave paintings in the Matobo Hills. The cave paintings had surfaces composed of small dots, and the artist emulated this technique in [i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i]. It is also noteworthy that the color scheme of red, yellow, black, and green is reminiscent of many 20th century Black American artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacob-lawrence]Jacob Lawrence[/url], James H. Phillips, and Charles Searles. Through bold color schemes and geometric patterns typical for African textiles, these artists wanted to establish an aesthetic connection to Africa. In [i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i] Ofili aimed to create art that is humorous and enjoyable to audiences. At the same time, through parody and exaggeration, Ofili’s painting makes potent commentary and contributes to severe discussions on Blaxploitation and dominant representations of black masculinity."
No Woman No Cry,Ofili Chris,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"The painting [i]No Woman No Cry[/i] (1998) is a tribute to Stephen Lawrence, a black teenager who was murdered in a racially motivated attack in East London in 1993.  A 1998 public inquiry into the Metropolitan Police Service concluded that their handling of the case was severely impaired by professional incompetence and institutional racism. The woman in Ofili’s painting is Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence. She, for five years, fiercely campaigned for a public inquiry that ultimately resulted in an overhaul of Britain’s race relations legislation.

Ofili began working on [i]No Woman No Cry[/i] by painting multiple layers of luminous shades of pale green and bright yellow. He then created a crisscross of sequences of circles that form rough diamond shapes, made from cutouts of reproductions of artworks by British abstract artist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/bridget-riley]Bridget Riley[/url]. Cutting across these are horizontal dotted lines broken up by small hearts, which are strategically placed in the middle of the diamond shapes. In the background, Ofili wrote ‘[i]RIP Stephen Lawrence 1974-1993[/i]’, which is faintly seen underneath the top layers of the painting. Because Ofili used fluorescent paint, the written text is particularly visible under ultraviolet lighting. The woman wears a thin black necklace with a pendant made from a lump of elephant dung that is filled with map pins. Ofili also placed two large lumps of elephant dung on the floor to hold up the painting that leans on the wall. The artist titled the painting [i]No Woman No Cry[/i], after the 1974 song by legendary reggae musician Bob Marley. The title offers comfort and solace to the female figure, whose pale blue tears flow - each tear has a small photograph of Stephen Lawrence in its center.

From 1996, Ofili made a shift from painting mainly abstract works to focusing on portraits of large individual figures. [i]No Woman No Cry[/i] shares several traits with other paintings from the period. For instance, the use of mixed media, such as beads, map pins, collage, and elephant dung, is recurring in other works: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/the-holy-virgin-mary-1996][i]The Holy Virgin Mary[/i][/url] (1996), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/dream-1998][i]Dream[/i][/url] (1998), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/third-eye-vision-1999][i]Third Eye Vision[/i][/url] (1999). Also, while many of Ofili’s works are purposefully garish, ironic, and humorous, like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/double-captain-shit-and-the-legend-of-the-black-stars-1997][i]Double Captain Shit and the Legend of the Black Stars[/i][/url] (1997) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/pimpin-aint-easy-1997][i]Pimpin’ ain't easy[/i][/url] (1997), [i]No Woman No Cry[/i] strikes a very different tone. The artist was deeply moved by Doreen Lawrence’s overwhelming grief and dignified stance - with each interview, she grew stronger and became more emboldened. This admiration and respect come through in a very tender and noble portrait. While the painting refers to a specific incident, it can also be understood as a universal portrayal of melancholy and grief.

In 1999, the painting was purchased by the Tate Museum in London. Because of the variety of materials applied, particularly the elephant dung, it is hard to predict how it will endure daily museum conditions in the long term. For this reason, the painting is closely monitored. It is likely that at some point, the elephant dung will fall off. However, there are instructions on how it should be replaced and remade from elephant dung at the London Zoo."
Afro Red Web,Ofili Chris,Neo-Expressionism,figurative,"[i]Afro Red Web[/i] (2002-2003) was one of five paintings made for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/all-works#!#filterName:Series_within-reach-2003,resultType:masonry][i]Within Reach[/i][/url], the exhibition inside the British Pavilion at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003. The exhibition that featured Ofili's works was created in collaboration with the Ghanaian British architect David Adjaye. Initially inspired by the Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico, Grenada, and especially Trinidad), the series of paintings represents a vision of paradise.

Along with the paintings, the installation featured [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/union-black-2003][i]Union Black[/i][/url] (2003): the Union Jack flag, where the traditional colors (blue, white, and red) are replaced with red, black, and green. Ofili also used this palette for the paintings in the exhibition. The colors of Ofili's flag relate to Marcus Garvey's Pan African U.N.I.A banner from the 1920s, and the idea of African American and Afro-Caribbean communities returning to Africa to form a modern Pan-African national community. This unfulfilled aspiration was addressed by an African-American artist, [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-hammons]David Hammons[/url] in [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-hammons/african-american-flag-1990][i]African-American Flag[/i][/url] (1990), and Ofili's [i]Union Black[/i] builds on this concept. In this way, Ofili marked his paradise - an imaginary kingdom that represents his British identity and African ancestry. While he was inspired by the Pan-African political movement and the 1960s cultural movement 'Black is Beautiful,' he was more interested in recapturing their mood and spirit rather than their political activity.

Across five paintings of [i]Within Reach[/i] series, Ofili depicts an Afro couple in different stages of paradise. However, this paradise is not cloudless. In [i]Afro Red Web[/i], the threat is articulated in the form of a red web. Ofili explained that he imagined a fly caught in a net and the risk of an approaching spider. The lush scenery and rich foliage prompt associations to the biblical Garden of Eden; however, Ofili turns the story on its head by reversing the roles.  Here, the woman seems to be passive and oblivious, while the man is either part of the web or the predator. The sensuous woman somewhat innocently kisses the man on the cheek, unaware of his blazing red eyes and the dagger clenched in his fist. The painting, dominated by a bold red, was presented in a green room. In an adjacent red room, the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/afro-jezebel-2003][i]Afro Jezebel[/i][/url] (2002-2003) served as its counterpart. The woman's kiss also references the Garden of Gethsemane, and the betrayal of Jesus by his disciple Judas Iscariot. It's clarified in [i]Afro Jezebel[/i]: the man is engrossed in the embrace, while the woman still maintains a double vision, simultaneously looking out and looking at him.

The composition in [i]Afro Red Web[/i] is formed from geometric patterns, which all seem to branch out from the woman's kiss. Ofili used his unique form of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism]pointillism[/url], forming perfect tiny dots, over which he layered multiple coats of resin lacquer. The black elements of the composition have two tones, glossy and matt, adding to the textural and tactile quality of the painting. The radiating sun or star in the upper left corner is made out of elephant dung, a signature in Ofili's art. Like in other paintings, he also used lumps of elephant dung to prop up the artwork."
Iscariot Blues,Ofili Chris,Neo-Expressionism,"figurative, religious painting","[i]Iscariot Blues[/i] (2006) is part of a series of blue paintings that the artist executed after his move to Trinidad in 2005. Ofili first visited Trinidad in 2000, as part of an artist residency. Soon after, the impact of the Caribbean environment became noticeable in his art. It was one of the inspirations for the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/all-works#!#filterName:Series_within-reach-2003,resultType:masonry]series of red, black, and green paintings[/url], which were exhibited at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003.

The blue paintings signify a significant stylistic departure for Ofili, who is best known for applying different materials to his paintings, like paper cutouts, glitter, pins, and elephant dung. Instead, in [i]Iscariot Blues[/i], and other paintings like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/blue-riders-2006][i]Blue Riders[/i][/url] (2006) and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/blue-steps-fall-from-grace-2011][i]Blue Steps (Fall from Grace)[/i][/url] (2011), the artist focused on the flatness of the surface and a monochrome palette of blue, black and silver. This new approach is connected to his life in Trinidad, especially to the experience of nighttime. The artist explained how twilight and darkness in Trinidad ignite the imagination: the hilly landscape and dense vegetation give a sense that something is happening on the other side. Unlike night in a big city that is illuminated by artificial lights, in Trinidad, one must rely on the moonlight and the sensitivity of the eyes. In these paintings, Ofili aims to capture this mood, the night that is mysterious and even frightening. The blue paintings took their name from the early 20th-century [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism]Expressionist[/url] group [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/der-blaue-reiter-the-blue-rider]The Blue Rider[/url], established by Russian and German artists. The art historian Christopher Zuschlag pointed out that philosophical and artistic ideas associated with The Blue Rider artists like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/franz-marc]Franz Marc[/url] appeal to Ofili: the idea of creating a synthesis between the arts, both in connecting it to music and in equally valuing European and non-European art, high art and folk art.

[i]Iscariot Blues[/i] portrays two local musicians playing Parang, favorite folk music from Trinidad and Tobago, and the Bobolee figure - an Easter tradition in Trinidad where an effigy of Judas Iscariot is hung and beaten by villagers on Good Friday. The shapes of the musicians were inspired by plywood cutouts of musicians in Lopinot, a village in Trinidad. The artist was attracted to the flatness of the cutouts, and he took a few photographs from which he later painted the figures before adding the figure of Judas. Ofili chose to paint Judas Iscariot naked to reflect the feeling of shame and regret that led Judas to commit suicide after he betrayed Jesus Christ. The nudity exposes the figure, his shame, and remorse. By using a silver base, Ofili’s figure of Judas glows, as if it is absorbing or reflecting the moonlight. The monochrome palette of blues is also linked to Trinidad folklore: the ‘[i]jab jab[/i]’ or ‘blue devil’ is a carnival beast that stalks the streets. In the context of the Carnival, blue symbolizes ‘evil’ and ‘destruction.’ The artist will later directly address the folklore of the ‘blue devil’ in the painting [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/chris-ofili/blue-devils-2014][i]Blue Devils[/i][/url] (2014)."
Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995,Emin Tracey,Conceptual Art,installation,"Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (1995), also known as ""The Tent"", was an artwork created by Tracey Emin RA (born 3 July 1963), an English artist and a leading member of the group known as Britartists or YBAs (Young British Artists). The work was a tent with the appliquéd names of, literally, everyone she had ever slept with, but not necessarily in the sexual sense. It achieved iconic status, was owned by Charles Saatchi, and was destroyed in the 2004 Momart London warehouse fire. She has refused to recreate it."
My Bed,Emin Tracey,Conceptual Art,installation,"My Bed is a work by the British artist Tracey Emin. First created in 1998, it was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in 1999 as one of the shortlisted works for the Turner Prize. It consisted of her bed with bedroom objects in an abject state, and gained much media attention. Although it did not win the prize, its notoriety has persisted.

The artwork generated considerable media furore, particularly over the fact that the bedsheets were stained with bodily secretions and the floor had items from the artist's room (such as condoms, a pair of knickers with menstrual period stains, other detritus, and functional, everyday objects, including a pair of slippers). The bed was presented in the state that Emin claimed it had been when she said she had not got up from it for several days due to suicidal depression brought on by relationship difficulties.

Two performance artists, Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi, jumped on the bed with bare torsos in order to improve the work, which they thought had not gone far enough. They called their performance Two Naked Men Jump Into Tracey's Bed. The men also had a pillow fight on the bed for around fifteen minutes, to applause from the crowd, before being removed by security guards. The artists were detained but no further action was taken. Prior to its Tate Gallery showing, the work had appeared elsewhere, including Japan, where there were variant surroundings, including at one stage a hangman's noose hanging over the bed. This was not present when it was displayed at the Tate.

My Bed was bought by Charles Saatchi for £150,000 and displayed as part of the first exhibition when the Saatchi Gallery opened its new premises at County Hall, London (which it has now vacated). Saatchi also installed the bed in a dedicated room in his own home."
"The ship is going under, the ice is breaking through",Baumgarten Lothar,,,"Lothar Baumgarten concentrates here on the fragility of the domed glass structure of the Palacio de Cristal to create a sound sculpture from a series of audio recordings of ice thawing of the Hudson River in upstate New York. Within the transparent architectural presence of its glass corpus, the deafening sound of the ice becomes a tonal analogy for the crashing stocks and assets of financial markets; it concerns greedy speculation about unlimited economic growth and the resulting impact on the dramatically changing global climate.

MoMA Poll,Haacke Hans,Conceptual Art,installation,"In 1970 Hans Haacke proposed a work for the exhibition entitled Information to be held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (an exhibition meant to be an overview of current younger artists), according to which the visitors would be asked to vote on a current socio-political issue. The proposal was accepted, and Haacke prepared his installation, entitled MoMA Poll, but did not hand in the specific question until right before the opening of the show. His query asked, ""Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?"" Visitors were asked to deposit their answers in the appropriate one of two transparent Plexiglas ballot boxes. At the end of the exhibition, there were approximately twice as many Yes ballots as No ballots. Haacke's question commented directly on the involvements of a major donor and board member at MOMA, Nelson Rockefeller. This installation is an early example of what in the art world came to be known as institutional critique."
Global Marketing,Haacke Hans,Conceptual Art,installation,"One of Haacke's targets is Charles Saatchi, a powerful collector of contemporary art and trustee of the Tate Gallery in London who recently opened his own museum in that city. Charles and Maurice Saatchi are the founders of Saatchi & Saatchi, perhaps the largest advertising agency in the world. ''Global Marketing'' is a large black cube on which Haacke has documented in black letters the scope of Saatchi's business involvements in South Africa. The black on black recalls the tough, 1960's black-on-black paintings of Ad Reinhardt, but in Haacke's work the glossy black on matte black also suggests a tuxedo. The box builds on the deathly quality of Tony Smith's black cubic sculpture ''Die.'' (Michael Brenson)"
Spiral Jetty,Smithson Robert,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Built on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah entirely of mud, salt crystals, basalt rocks and water, Spiral Jetty forms a 1,500-foot-long (460 m), 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake. The water level of the lake varies with precipitation in the mountains surrounding the area, revealing the jetty in times of drought and submerging it during times of normal precipitation.

Smithson reportedly chose the Rozel Point site based on the blood-red color of the water and its connection with the primordial sea. The red hue of the water is due to the presence of salt-tolerant bacteria and algae that thrive in the extreme 27 percent salinity of the lake's north arm, which was isolated from fresh water sources by the building of a causeway by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1959.

Smithson was attracted to the Rozel Point site because of the stark anti-pastoral beauty and industrial remnants from nearby Golden Spike National Historic Site, as well as an old pier and a few unused oil rigs. While observing the construction of the piece from a helicopter, Smithson reportedly remarked ""et in Utah ego"" as a counterpoint to the famous pastoral Baroque painting et in Arcadia ego by Nicolas Poussin.

To move the rock into the lake, Smithson hired Bob Phillips of Parson's Construction of nearby Ogden, Utah, who used two dump trucks, a large tractor, and a front end loader to haul the 6,650 tons of rock and earth into the lake. It is reported that Smithson had a difficult time convincing a contractor to accept the unusual proposal. Spiral Jetty was the first of his pieces to require the acquisition of land rights and earthmoving equipment.

He began work on the jetty in April 1970. Construction took six days.

In 1970 during the construction of the jetty, Robert Smithson wrote and directed a 32-minute color film, ""Spiral Jetty"". The film was shot by Smithson and his wife Nancy Holt, and funded by Virgina Dawn and Douglas Christmas."
Partially Buried Woodshed,Smithson Robert,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Partially Buried Woodshed is a work of land art created by Robert Smithson. It was created at Kent State University in January 1970. The work has since been demolished, and only concrete remains in the grass. It is located southeast of the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus.

Shortly after the Kent State shootings, which took place on May 4, 1970, an inscription was added to the artwork that recontextualized the work in such a way that it came to be associated by some with the event.

In her 1996 multimedia work Partially Buried, visual artist Renée Green explores the history of the shootings within a wider historical and cultural context."
Sun Tunnels,Holt Nancy,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Sun Tunnels is located in the Great Basin Desert outside of the ghost town of Lucin, Utah. The work is a product of Holt’s interest in the great variation of intensity of the sun in the desert compared to the sun in the city. Holt searched for and found a site which was remote and empty.

""It is a very desolate area, but it is totally accessible, and it can be easily visited, making Sun Tunnels more accessible really than art in museums . . . A work like Sun Tunnels is always accessible . . . Eventually, as many people will see Sun Tunnels as would see many works in a city-in a museum anyway.""

The work consists of four massive concrete tunnels (18 feet long and nine feet in diameter), which are arranged in an “X” configuration to total a length of 86 feet (26 m). Each tunnel reacts differently to the sun, aligned with the sunrise, sunset, of the summer or winter solstice. Someone visiting the site would see the tunnels immediately with their contrast to the fairly undifferentiated desert landscape. Approaching the work, which can be seen one to one-and-a-half miles away, the viewer’s perception of space is questioned as the tunnels change views as a product of their landscape.

The tunnels not only provide a much-needed shelter from the sweltering desert sun, but once inside the dazzling effect of the play of light within the tunnels can be seen. The top of each tunnel has small holes, forming on each, the constellations of Draco, Perseus, Columba, and Capricorn, respectively. The diameters of the holes differ in relation to the magnitude of the stars represented. These holes cast spots of daylight in the dark interiors of the tunnels, which appear almost like stars. Holt has said of the tunnels, ""It’s an inversion of the sky/ground relationship-bringing the sky down to the earth."" This is a common theme in Holt’s work. She sometimes creates this relationship with reflecting pools and shadow patterns marked on the ground, like in her work Star Crossed."
Stone Enclosure: Rock Rings,Holt Nancy,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Brown Mountain Stone, 10'h. with outer ring 40' d. and inner ring 20' d. Siting was critical to Nancy Holt's work, which is tied to the terrain of this campus, the natural beauty of the Northwest and to Bellingham as a seaport community. Previous to Western's work, Holt had designed work which aligned itself to the sun. At Western her rock enclosure is mapped on earth according to the celestial layout of the north star; that is, the four arches, running north and south, are calculated from the north star which is used by coastal navigators. The circular holes referring to points on the compass give a more horizontal direction out onto the landscape. Photo credit: David Scherrer."
Thirty Below,Holt Nancy,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"This project was commissioned for the thirteenth Olympic Winter Games held in 1980. It is made up of red brick, steel, concrete, and concrete block. It is an open-ended tower rising 30' with a diameter of 9' 4"". Two 10' arches on a north-south axis allow entry at ground level. Four similar 8' openings all face the cardinal points. Low berms at the east and west sides lead up to two of the slotted windows that look into and through the piece."
Dark Star Park,Holt Nancy,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Dark Star Park was commissioned by Arlington County, Virginia in 1979, in conjunction with an urban-renewal project. Construction of the work began in 1984. Holt worked with an architect, landscape architect, engineers, and real estate developers on the project. The artwork is at once a park and a sculpture. Built on two-thirds of an acre of land where a run-down, old gas station and warehouse once stood, Holt transformed the space. The park consists of five spheres, two pools, four steel poles, a stairway, a large tunnel for passage, a smaller tunnel for viewing only and plantings of crown vetch, winter creeper, willow oak, and earth and grass.

The forms stand in stark contrast to the busy and highly developed commercial area that surrounds the space. There are places to walk and sit within the park, giving a passersby a chance to escape from the urban environment. Dark Star Park is more socially interactive than Holt’s other works. Holt paid attention to how people both inside and outside the park would see the spheres. The work alters the viewer’s perception by using curvilinear forms, such as the walkways that mimic the curving roads surrounding the site. Walking in the park or driving by it, viewers may mistake spheres of different sizes to actually be the same size or one sphere may eclipse another. The tunneled passages into the park frame certain sculptural elements, as do the reflections in the pools. However, Holt has made sure not to alienate the park entirely from its surroundings. The spheres are made of gunite (a sprayable mixture of cement and sand), asphalt, precast concrete tunnels, steel poles and stone masonry. These materials relate the park to the buildings located near the artwork.

The work explores the concept of time and our relationship to the universe. When approaching one of the spheres, a visitor to the park might be reminded of the lunar surface or when glancing at the quiet pools of water around the spheres, may relate them to craters. This is no coincidence. Holt has a fascination with solar eclipses, as well as in the shadows cast by the sun on the surface of the earth and the name of the park is a reference to the astronomical appearance of the large spheres that are its most distinct features. In speaking about the name Holt has said, ""It’s called Dark Star Park because in my imagination these spheres are like stars that have fallen to the ground-they no longer shine-so I think of the park/artwork in a somewhat celestial way."" By engaging the viewer with these spheres and the other elements surrounding them in the park, Holt brings the vast scale of nature and the cosmos back to human scale. Time is also a major part of this work. Once a year on August 1 at 9:32 am, the shadows cast by two of the spheres and their four adjacent poles align with permanent asphalt shadow patterns outlined on the ground. This date was selected by the artist to commemorate the day in 1860 when William Ross bought the land that today is Rosslyn, Virginia, where the park is situated.

The work was surveyed in June 1995. At that time “treatment was needed.”. Thus, seven years later, when the park was finally restored in 2002 it was long overdue."
Sky Mound,Holt Nancy,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Located in Northern New Jersey, Sky Mound sits where a 57-acre (230,000 m2), 100-foot (30 m)-high landfill once stood. The state’s Hackensack Meadowland Development Commission (HMDC) asked Holt to reclaim the site in an effort to provide an environmentally safe spot for plant and animal life to reside and for humans to enjoy.

Still unfinished in April 2008, the landfill is to be turned into an earth sculpture and public park. The landfill has been covered with grass. Ten mounds stand upon the site, as well as steel poles, plants, and a pond, designed for the approximately 250 species of migratory birds that visit the area seasonally. There will eventually be wind indicators and gravel paths. On several astronomically significant dates each year, the work will provide its viewer with unique views of the sun, moon, and several stars.

In addition, a series of arcing pipes will go down into the landfill, recovering methane from the 10 million tons of garbage below. This will provide an alternative source of energy for those in the community.

Sky Mound’s location makes it visible and accessible to many people. Holt believes the work will increase awareness of the complex problem of how we dispose of our waste and trash. It also raises questions about the sun, as every ecosystem depends on the sun and its energy for survival. In 1991, funding on Sky Mound was stopped to perform a technological study at the site; currently construction remains postponed."
Double Negative,Heizer Michael,Environmental (Land) Art,installation,"Double Negative is a piece of land art located in the Moapa Valley on Mormon Mesa (or Virgin River Mesa) near Overton, Nevada. The work consists of a long trench in the earth, 30 feet (9 m) wide, 50 feet (15 m) deep, and 1500 feet (457 m) long, created by the displacement of 244,000 tons of rock, mostly rhyolite and sandstone. Two trenches straddle either side of a natural canyon (into which the excavated material was dumped). The ""negative"" in the title thus refers in part to both the natural and man-made negative space that constitutes the work. The work essentially consists of what is not there, what has been displaced.

In 1969 the art dealer Virginia Dwan funded the purchase of the 60-acre site for Double Negative and in turn the artist transferred the property deeds to Dwan. In 1971 Heizer prevented the Dwan Gallery from selling the work. Dwan then donated Double Negative to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MoCA) in 1984, with Heizer’s blessing, to coincide with “In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction”. Among the terms of the agreement with the museum is the fact that, according to the artist's wishes, MoCA will undertake no conservation of the piece as Heizer wants nature to eventually reclaim the land through weather and erosion.

For the solo exhibition ""In Context: Michael Heizer, Geometric Extraction"", MoCA was able to include a photographic pan­o­rama of Heizer’s work. For the large-scale, historical survey of land art “Ends of the Earth” at MoCA in 2012, Heizer did not want any representation of Double Negative to be included in the exhibition. A good aerial photograph appears in the informative catalog, but Heizer reportedly worried that documentation in a museum gallery misrepresents sculpture that can be known only through physical experience.

The work is currently owned by MoCA and is accessible by four-wheel drive vehicle or motorcycle."
Levitated Mass,Heizer Michael,"Environmental (Land) Art, Minimalism",installation,"Levitated Mass by artist Michael Heizer is composed of a 456-foot-long slot constructed on LACMA's campus, over which is placed a 340-ton granite megalith. The slot gradually descends to fifteen feet in depth, running underneath the boulder. As with other works by the artist, such as Double Negative (1969), the monumental negative form is key to the experience of the artwork.

Heizer conceived of the artwork in 1969; a drawing of the work is in the collection of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. The artist discovered an appropriate boulder only decades later, in Riverside County, California. The boulder is one component of the artwork, as is the 456-foot-long slot beneath it and the surrounding environment.

Taken whole, Levitated Mass speaks to the expanse of art history, from ancient traditions of creating artworks from megalithic stone, to modern forms of abstract geometries and cutting-edge feats of engineering."
Space That Sees,Turrell James,Light and Space,installation,"Space That Sees belongs to Turrell’s “Skyspace” series, begun in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which can be seen as performance pieces responding to and interacting with environmental conditions and atmospheric fluctuations over time. Observing the shifting hues of the sky from inside a pristine, rectilinear space, viewers experience a connection to their surroundings. But more than that, the artist, by confronting us with the empty space, turns our mind to our own mode of seeing.

For his Jerusalem Skyspace, Turrell chose a semicircular terrace along the western slope of the Art Garden. The site was cut in two and dug out, so that the terrace now enfolds a shrine-like inner space evoking places of worship such as pyramids, mausoleums, or temples. A square opening cut into its ceiling makes a frame for an ever-changing abstract ""picture” of the sky, recalling by contrast Baroque illusionist ceilings crowded with painted clouds, saints, and angels.

Space That Sees invites a kind of meditative experience. Twilight conditions yield a particularly startling effect, with the flat surface of the sky turning almost imperceptibly from deep blue to velvet black while the room itself seems to grow increasingly brighter, so that the physical conjunction at the roof opening of interior and exterior becomes a catalyst in the light’s passage from day to night. Turrell saw the installation as an “allegory of light that we generate from inside and light that comes from outside: the emergence into space where light comes forth as in a dream.”

Roden Crater,Turrell James,Environmental (Land) Art,"installation, architecture","Roden Crater is a cinder cone type of volcanic cone from an extinct volcano, with a remaining interior volcanic crater. It is located northeast of the city of Flagstaff in northern Arizona, United States. The artist James Turrell, for his land art project, acquired the 400,000-year-old, 3-mile-wide (4.8 km) crater's land. Turrell has since been transforming the inner cone of the crater into a massive naked-eye observatory, designed specifically for the viewing and experiencing sky-light, solar, and celestial phenomena. The fleeting Winter and Summer solstice events will be highlighted. The Dia Art Foundation is continuing to advocate for the development of James Turrell's Roden Crater project in the Painted Desert in Arizona which was begun in the 1970s with Dia's support. James Turrell, who purchased the Roden Crater in 1979, had plans to open the crater for public viewing in 2011."
